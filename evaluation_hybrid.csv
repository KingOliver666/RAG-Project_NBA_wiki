How did I get here?"" Also in the Katz interview, Ezeli remarked on his struggles to learn the game:""I didn\'t know what I was doing.

During the 2011–12 NBA season, Allen was privately frustrated with trade rumors in February, issues with teammate Rajon Rondo, and an ankle injury that ultimately required surgery in June 2012 to remove bone spurs. The Celtics lost in seven games to the Miami Heat in the 2012 Eastern Conference finals. = 2012–2013: second championship Allen\'s initial plan in the summer of 2012 was to stay with the Boston Celtics. He was reportedly seeking a three-year, $24 million contract whereas the Celtics were offering a two-year, $12 million deal. Further internal discord with a bench role and a Rondo-focused approach led to Allen rejecting the Celtics and instead choosing to sign a two-year, $6 million deal with the Miami Heat. The Heat were limited to their mid-level exception amount of slightly more than $3 million per season. During Allen\'s first season with the Miami Heat, he averaged 10.9 points per game and made 88.6% of his free throws while playing an average of 25.8 minutes per game.

Allen also had one defensive rebound and two assists. In Game 7, which the Heat won 95–88 to win its second consecutive championship, Allen played 20 minutes off the bench. Although he made none of 4 field goal attempts and had 3 turnovers, Allen recorded 4 defensive rebounds and 4 assists. 2013–2014: final playing year On June 29, 2013, Allen picked up his $3.23 million player option to stay with the Heat through the 2013–14 NBA season. During the regular season, Allen played in 73 games, starting 9 of them, averaging 9.6 points and shooting 37 percent from three-point range. In the playoffs, Allen scored 19 points on 4–7 three-point shooting in game 4 of the conference semifinals against the Brooklyn Nets. Then in Game 3 against the Indiana Pacers in an Eastern Conference finals rematch, Allen hit four 3-point shots in the fourth quarter and put them up 2–1 in the series. The Heat won the series in six games to advance to the NBA Finals for the fourth straight year and Allen\'s second. The Heat faced the Spurs again in the 2014 NBA Finals, but they lost the series in five games. = Allen became a free agent in the 2014 off-season, and after much anticipation of a return at some point during the 2014–15 season, he announced his decision to sit out the season and focus on 2015–16. However, he did not end up joining a team. In July 2016, Allen began mulling a comeback, and admitted he was ""intrigued"" by the possibility of competing for another championship.

However, he did not end up joining a team. In July 2016, Allen began mulling a comeback, and admitted he was ""intrigued"" by the possibility of competing for another championship. The following month, Allen had talks with the Boston Celtics and the Milwaukee Bucks regarding a possible return, but ultimately decided to officially retire on November 1, 2016.

In October 2021, Allen was honored as one of the league\'s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA\'s 75th Anniversary Team. He was also named in the top 75 players by The Athletic. In 1998, Allen co-starred alongside Denzel Washington in the Spike Lee film He Got Game as high school basketball phenomenon Jesus Shuttlesworth. Roger Ebert praised his performance and said Allen ""is that rarity: an athlete who can act,"" while New York magazine described him as ""graceful and fast in the basketball scenes"" while giving ""a somberly effective minimalist performance."" His role as Jesus Shuttlesworth earned him that name as a nickname from teammates and fans. Allen also appeared as Marcus Blake in the 2001 film Harvard Man.', 'Allan Nathaniel Ray (born June 17, 1984) is an American sports agent and former professional basketball player. He played college basketball for four years at Villanova University.', 'For that year, he averaged 16.5 points and finished third in the voting for Rookie of the Year honors.

That season, Pierce led the Celtics to the playoffs for the first time in seven years and on to the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 3 of the conference finals, the Celtics pulled off the largest fourth-quarter comeback in NBA playoff history, with Pierce scoring 19 of his 28 points in the final 12 minutes as Boston overcame a 21-point deficit to beat the New Jersey Nets 94–90. The win gave the Celtics a 2–1 advantage in the series; however, the Nets went on to win the series in six games. From 2002 to 2006, Pierce made the All-Star team every season. He led the league in total points (2,144) in 2002 and was an All-NBA Third Team selection in 2002 and 2003. In the 2007 offseason, Pierce requested a trade to the Dallas Mavericks, and stated that he would publicly demand a trade unless the Celtics acquired a co-star for him. A three-team trade between the Celtics, Mavericks, and the Atlanta Hawks was nearly completed, but Atlanta canceled the trade upon learning that Boston would receive a first-round pick. Instead, the Celtics decided to fulfill Pierce\'s request for a co-star. NBA champion and Finals MVP (2007–2008) Prior to the 2007–08 season, the Celtics acquired the services of fellow NBA All-Stars Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett. The pair combined with Pierce to form a ""Big Three"". The Celtics completed the largest single-season turnaround in NBA history, with the ""Big Three"" leading Boston to 66 wins in the regular season, a 42-game improvement. However, the team struggled initially in the playoffs.', ""Upon joining the Celtics, Allen changed his jersey to number 20 because Paul Pierce already had number 34 in Boston. On November 4, 2007, Allen passed 17,000 points for his career with his first of two 3-pointers in overtime in a 98–95 victory against the Toronto Raptors, in which he sank the game winning 3-pointer with three seconds remaining in overtime. On February 13, 2008, Allen was named as the replacement for injured East All-Star Caron Butler of the Washington Wizards, who was out with a left hip flexor strain, for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans. While LeBron James was given the All-Star MVP Award, many analysts, including the TNT commentators of the game, felt it should have gone to Allen, who scored 14 points in a stretch of 2 minutes and 30 seconds in the fourth quarter to seal the win for the East team. On March 28, 2008, Allen was honored as the 3rd best of the 20 greatest players in franchise history during Milwaukee's 40th Anniversary Team Celebration, but could not attend the festivities because of the Celtics' game against the New Orleans Hornets.

When his father played for the Milwaukee Bucks, Robinson remembers being kicked off the court by head coach George Karl. During a meeting in the Philadelphia 76ers locker room with Allen Iverson, Iverson referred to him as ""Shorty"", and the younger Robinson noted that he was as tall as Iverson, saying ""Man, I’m your height right now! Who are you calling shorty?"" Robinson attended Grimmer Middle School in Schererville, Indiana prior to attending Lake Central High School in St. John, Indiana.', 'Some of his family members sold crack cocaine, and his father left his family at age 10. He attended public school in his youth but attended Episcopal Academy for high school. He became one of the top high school basketball players in the country at Episcopal, receiving scholarship offers at 16 schools. He chose to attend Penn to study accounting at the Wharton School; he had planned on being an accountant in his youth. Allen was a four-year starter at Penn alongside future NBA players Matt Maloney and Ira Bowman. Allen and the Quakers were undefeated from his freshman season to his junior season in the Ivy League. The team\'s 48-game conference winning streak is the best in Ivy League history. He averaged 13.7 points per game in his career for Penn. = Allen was selected 49th overall (2nd round, pick 20) by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 1995 NBA draft. Until Miye Oni was selected in 2019, Allen was the most recent Ivy League player to be drafted to the NBA.

On December 14, 2009, Allen was named interim head coach of the Penn men\'s basketball team after the firing of Glen Miller. On March 31, 2010, he was announced as the new permanent head coach of the Penn Men\'s Basketball team. He resigned his position as head coach effective on March 10, 2015. = Allen joined the Boston Celtics in 2015 under head coach Brad Stevens. Allen was one of Boston\'s longer-tenured assistants and was with the team for all but two seasons of the Brad Stevens era. = In summer 2021, Allen announced he was leaving the Celtics\' coaching staff to join Dwane Casey in Detroit.

He was ordered to pay back $18,000 in addition to a $200,000 fine. He would testify on behalf of the federal government against the man he said had bribed him – Phillip Esformes. During Esformes\'s trial, Allen testified that he had received about $300,000 in bribes from Esformes, and that the student in question was Esformes\'s son. On February 26, 2020, the NCAA announced penalties against Allen and the Penn men\'s basketball program stemming from the bribes. The program was placed on two years\' probation but did not receive a postseason ban. Allen received a 15-year show-cause penalty from the NCAA, effective until February 20, 2035. It is the longest ever handed down to a (former) head coach. During this period, any school that hires Allen must ""show cause"" for why it should not be sanctioned for doing so. In an unusual move, if Allen gets a head coaching job after the show-cause expires, he must sit out the first half of the first season of his return. It is very difficult for a head coach to return to the collegiate ranks even after a show-cause expires, since many presidents and athletic directors are extremely reluctant to hire someone with a show-cause on his record. Only four coaches have ever worked in college basketball again after receiving a show-cause.

His vision apparently left him for a period of time and his eyeball had seemed to come loose from the socket, leading most to believe it was an extremely serious injury. However, his vision returned and it turned out to be only soft tissue damage. He was able to play less than a week later in the NCAA tournament, without goggles. In his first game back, he led Villanova in scoring. While on the video it appeared as though his eye came loose from the socket, his eyelid actually went behind his eye, giving off the impression of his eye coming loose.

That was the only major injury in his career, and he never missed another game after returning from that injury. Stockton earned the ""old school"" tag for his physical play; surveys of athletes and fans alike often judged him among the toughest players in the NBA, usually just behind teammate Karl Malone. Stockton\'s tenacity also earned him a reputation among some in the league as being a dirty player, as suggested by a poll Sports Illustrated conducted in 1997 where he was voted as the second dirtiest player in the league behind Dennis Rodman. His patented ""short shorts"" became known as ""Stocktons""—since he continued to wear the style long after the rest of the league had adopted a baggier look. Stockton\'s career is also notable for its consistency and longevity. He remained a starting NBA player until his retirement at age 41. Stockton avoided most endorsements and stayed loyal to Utah despite being offered more money by other teams. In 1996, he agreed to a deal that made salary-cap space available so the team could improve, but in exchange, he insisted on guaranteed Delta Center ice time for his son\'s hockey team. For many years, Karl Malone and Stockton were the Jazz\'s one-two punch. The two played a record 1,412 regular season games together as teammates. Many of Stockton\'s assists resulted from passes to Malone. Stockton and Malone have been described as the greatest pick-and-roll combination of all time. Stockton and Malone are also considered the two best players to never have won an NBA championship. Stockton holds a commanding lead for the NBA record for career assists with 15,806.

In total, James played a then career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Chicago Bulls. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Atlanta Hawks to advance to the NBA Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals. For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities. Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before losing in six games. Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game. In the 2015 offseason, James declined his $21.5 million player option and re-signed on a two-year, $46.9 million contract that again carried a second year player option. During the 2015–16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers\' coach David Blatt. Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East. James\'s final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting. In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the NBA Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Golden State Warriors, who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season. To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses. James responded by registering back-to-back 41-point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a chasedown block on Andre Iguodala\'s go-ahead layup attempt, as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city\'s first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals. James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7, and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game, he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection. 2016–2018: End of second stint in Cleveland Following the championship, James again opted out of his contract and re-signed with the Cavaliers, this time on a three-year, $100 million contract, in which the final year was a player option. The 2016–17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers; James later described it as one of the ""strangest"" years of his career. Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, James publicly criticized Cleveland\'s front office for constructing a team that he felt was too ""top heavy"", for which he received countercriticism. The Cavaliers finished the season as the East\'s second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game. In Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Indiana Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Jordan as the league\'s all-time postseason scoring leader. The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to the NBA Finals for the third consecutive time against the Golden State Warriors, who had signed James\'s rival Kevin Durant during the off-season. Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12.0 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games. Prior to the start of the 2017–18 season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by trading Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James. After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December. Their turnaround began with a victory over the Wizards on November 3 where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record. In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort. The next month, James won his third All-Star Game MVP Award, after posting 29 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, and several key plays to help Team LeBron win over Team Curry. Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double digits. James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, and 4.2 turnovers per game. In the playoffs, James guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the Golden State Warriors.

In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland lost 124–114 in overtime. Following the loss, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series.

Two days later, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers on a four-year, $153.5 million contract; the deal was officially completed on July 9. In an interview with Sports Illustrated, James\'s agent Rich Paul explained: ""In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do."" Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination. The Lakers expected James to immediately transform them into a championship contender after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the Finals since 2010. Following his signing, the team rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. To begin the 2018–19 season, the Lakers struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games. In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James\'s strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers.

In March, the Lakers announced that James would begin a minutes restriction, and he was later officially ruled out for the rest of the season.

Despite his inconsistent campaign, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in twelve years that he did not make the All-NBA First Team. 2019–2020: Fourth NBA championship During the offseason, the Lakers hired Frank Vogel as their new head coach, and traded the majority of their young core to the Pelicans for superstar big man Anthony Davis. James immediately embraced the team\'s much-improved roster by transforming his playing style, moving to full-time point guard, and competing with a more consistent defensive effort. Behind James\'s leadership, the Lakers opened the 2019–20 season with a 17–2 record, matching the best start in franchise history. On January 25, James scored his 33,644th career point, passing Kobe Bryant for third on the all-time regular season scoring list. The following day, Bryant died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California. James delivered an improvised eulogy in honor of Bryant at Staples Center, before a January 31 game against the Portland Trail Blazers. In early March, before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, James led the Lakers to a victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in a matchup of conference leaders, followed by a streak-breaking victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. Regular season play resumed in July and concluded in August within the confined NBA Bubble, where James ended the regular season as the league leader in assists for the first time in his career, averaging 10.2 assists per game. He earned a record 16th All-NBA Team selection as part of the First Team, extending his record First Team selections to 13. The Lakers entered the playoffs as the top seed in the West and advanced to the NBA Finals convincingly, with only three total losses along the way. In Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals against the Denver Nuggets, James helped clinch the conference championship by scoring a game-high 38 points, including 16 in the fourth quarter. In the Finals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with his former team, the Miami Heat, and quickly took control of the series with a 2–0 lead. In Game 5, James had his best statistical performance of the Finals with 40 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists in a memorable duel with Miami\'s Jimmy Butler, but Los Angeles was ultimately defeated in a three-point game. The Lakers eliminated the Heat in Game 6, which earned James, who averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game during the series, his fourth NBA championship and fourth Finals MVP award. At 35 years and 287 days old, James became the second-oldest player in league history to win the award, and the only player in NBA history to win the award with three different franchises. James and teammate Danny Green also became the third and fourth players in NBA history to win at least one championship with three different teams each. 2020–2021: Back-to-back chase Following the championship, James would sign a two-year, $85.7 million extension that would keep him with the Lakers through the 2022–23 season. The 2020–2021 season, reduced to 72 games for each team and starting on December 22, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, began after the shortest offseason in NBA history with a 116–109 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.

He has also been a member of the USA National Team. Growing up in Sioux City, Iowa, Hinrich was exposed to basketball at an early age. His father, Jim, coached him from the third grade through high school. As a high school senior, Hinrich was named the 1999 Co-Iowa Mr. Basketball, along with future college teammate and roommate Nick Collison. Hinrich originally committed to play basketball at Iowa State but when the coach at the time, Tim Floyd, took the head coaching position for the NBA\'s Chicago Bulls, Hinrich changed his mind and decided to attend the University of Kansas. Hinrich helped Kansas to consecutive Final Fours in 2002 and 2003, his junior and senior seasons. He was drafted by the Chicago Bulls with the seventh pick in the 2003 NBA Draft, where he earned the nickname ""Captain Kirk"". Hinrich was the Bulls\' all-time leader in three-point field goals until November 29, 2024 when this was surpassed by Zach LaVine. After seven seasons with the Bulls, he had short stints with the Washington Wizards and Atlanta Hawks before returning to the Bulls in 2012. In 2016, he was traded back to the Atlanta Hawks. Hinrich was born to Jim and Nancy Hinrich of Sioux City, Iowa. His father played basketball at Briar Cliff College and later became a coach for Sioux City West High School. When Hinrich was about seven years old, Jim Hinrich visited Ray Nacke, his old college coach, and asked if Kirk could enroll in Nacke\'s summer camp for fourth, fifth, and sixth graders. Despite Nacke\'s hesitations, Hinrich was allowed to attend the camp, and played well against the older children. After just two years, Hinrich advanced to Nacke\'s camp for young teenagers, and excelled there, as well. Hinrich also played football at the quarterback position, and baseball as a pitcher. However, basketball was Hinrich\'s passion. His role model was Seattle SuperSonics star Gary Payton, a player known for his strong defense. With his father as coach, Hinrich\'s basketball team at Sioux City West High School achieved an 82–9 record over four years, and won the Iowa state championship when Hinrich was a senior. When he graduated, Hinrich was West High\'s all-time leader in points, steals, and assists. As a freshman with the University of Kansas Jayhawks, Hinrich tallied 123 assists and received the Clyde Lovellette Most Improved Player Award. The next year, he ranked eighth in the nation in assists per game (6.9), led his team in steals, and set a Kansas Jayhawks record with a .505 three-point shooting mark. Hinrich was also voted onto the Associated Press All-Big 12 Second Team and earned All Third Team status from the NCAA coaches. In his fourth and final season at Kansas, Hinrich, along with power forward Nick Collison, led the Jayhawks to the Final Four, and was voted onto the All-Big 12 Second Team by coaches and the media. He led his team in free throw shooting and three-point shooting, contributed 5.0 assists per game and received Kansas\' Ted Owens Defensive Player Award. Kansas lost to Syracuse in the championship Game but Hinrich was named the Midwest Region\'s Most Outstanding Player. He ranked second on his team in scoring and led it in three-pointers, while also contributing 3.5 assists per game, 3.9 rebounds per game and 1.9 steals a game. Following the season, he was named a third-team All-American by the Associated Press. On March 1, 2009, Kansas retired Hinrich\'s number 10 jersey and raised it to the rafters of Allen Fieldhouse. Hinrich\'s was the 25th jersey to be retired by Kansas and is an honor reserved for the highest caliber of player, which includes names like Wilt Chamberlain and Paul Pierce. Hinrich was quoted as saying: ""I don\'t know if there\'s a greater honor in basketball than to have your jersey hanging in the most historic basketball building in the world. It\'s an unbelievable honor."" = 2003 draft Hinrich was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the 2003 NBA draft with the seventh overall pick, resulting in mild surprise because he had been expected to be a mid to late first-round draft pick. Some doubted that his college game would translate successfully to the professional league, in part because he played shooting guard for his final two years in college and was considered too small to play that position professionally. Hinrich\'s high selection in the draft is credited to a good workout in front of NBA team scouts. The Bulls needed a point guard, as Jay Williams was severely injured in a motorcycle accident. After being picked by the Bulls, Hinrich said he knew they had a need at point guard: ""I know Jay... [W]e came out of high school the same year. He\'s a great guy. I feel for him, but the rumors were Chicago was going to take a point guard, so I had a good chance to be drafted. The situation is tough.', 'I don\'t think Kirk did anything. He was just playing aggressive defense. Kirk didn\'t do anything dirty. I don\'t appreciate him taking shots at our guys."" Sports Illustrated columnist Chris Mannix called Riley\'s comments ""on the border of hypocrisy"" while maintaining that Hinrich\'s grab of Wade\'s wrist, while illegal, was not a dirty play. ""For starters, the play itself hardly qualifies as dirty.', ""He was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks in the second round (44th pick overall) of the 1990 NBA draft. He was an assistant basketball coach at the University of Oklahoma under his former college coach Lon Kruger.

Hinrich started an exhibition game against Lithuania on August 13, 2006, and scored 10 points and 2 steals in a US win. After the game, Hinrich was asked about starting the game. He responded, ""We\'re playing in groups right now. I know when I get my time, I just try to make the best of it, make sure our team is successful. It\'s one of those deals when you play in groups in spurts like that, it\'s a little bit tougher. But, you don\'t hold back and give it everything you got because you know you\'ll be rested a lot."" In the FIBA world Championship semi-final, Team USA played against the Greece national team.

When Jordan joined the Washington Wizards, he asked Paxson to consider the head coaching job, but Paxson declined for the same reasons. = In April 2003, Paxson left his broadcasting position to become General Manager for the Bulls after the resignation of longtime Bulls general manager Jerry Krause. After a promising conclusion to the 2002–03 NBA season, Paxson pledged that the team would make the playoffs. He made headlines by signing former icon Scottie Pippen after years of bad relations between the franchise and one of the stars of their championship years. However, the Bulls opened the 2003–04 NBA season in sloppy and uninspired form, and Paxson opted to begin reshaping the character of the team by trading leading scorer Jalen Rose for Antonio Davis and firing friend and former teammate coach Bill Cartwright, replacing him with Scott Skiles. These moves had virtually no impact at all, and the Bulls finished Paxson\'s first season as general manager with a 23–59 record, second-worst in the NBA. In his second season, however, Paxson was able to reshape the franchise with remarkable speed through the draft. Kirk Hinrich made the NBA All-Rookie Team in 2003–04, and the 2004–05 rookie class yielded four major contributors, Ben Gordon, Luol Deng, Chris Duhon and Andrés Nocioni. After a long drought dating back to Jordan\'s departure, the Bulls returned to the playoffs and posted the third-best record in the Eastern Conference, a 24-game improvement from the previous year. The Bulls were knocked out of the playoffs in the first round, by the Washington Wizards despite having home-court advantage, a better regular-season record and a 2–0 lead in the best of seven playoff series. The absence of starting center and leading scorer Eddy Curry and promising small forward Luol Deng in this series played a major role, although Tyson Chandler and Kirk Hinrich both performed well. When center Eddy Curry showed possible symptoms of a heart problem shortly before the playoffs, Paxson took a cautious approach and would not clear Curry to play without extensive DNA testing. Ultimately, Curry was traded along with Antonio Davis to the New York Knicks for Michael Sweetney, Tim Thomas, and several draft picks. This trade would give them the Knicks\' first-round pick in 2006, which they eventually used to acquire Tyrus Thomas, and the right to swap first-round picks with the Knicks in 2007. The Bulls floundered in the season that followed, but the team made a late-season run to finish at 41-41 and earn a second consecutive trip to the playoffs – as well as a second consecutive first-round exit.', ""He played collegiately with the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team.

He speaks French, Italian and English. = Sefolosha was invited to join the junior Swiss national basketball team, and at 17 he began a professional career with Vevey Riviera Basket, in Switzerland\'s top domestic league. On a team trip to France, Sefolosha was approached by a French talent scout to play with Élan Chalon in the premier pro league in France. Sefolosha spent his first year in Chalon-sur-Saône playing with the junior under-21 squad, which traveled alongside the senior club.

Esposito moved to Fortitudo Bologna in 1993, playing there for two years. = Esposito had been noticed by NBA teams: the Cleveland Cavaliers through scout Rudy D'Amico and the Toronto Raptors through Bob Zuffelato. Though he had agreed terms with the Cavaliers, complications related to the NBA lockout meant he could only sign with the Raptors. When he signed a multi-year deal on 25 May 1995, he was the first player ever signed by the Canadian expansion team (predating the expansion draft and 1995 NBA draft by a month). Though Esposito wasn't the first Italian to play in an NBA game – preceded by Stefano Rusconi by three days – he was the first to score, on a free throw in a 15 November game against the Houston Rockets. With the Raptors' 21–61 season, he played 30 games, averaging 3.9 points and 0.8 assists, in 9.4 minutes. His best performance was 18 points, 2 assists, 2 offensive rebounds, and 2 turnovers, in 30 minutes, during a 6 April 1996 loss to the New York Knicks in Madison Square Garden. = Despite having two years left on his contract, and having a chance of a trade to the Philadelphia 76ers, Esposito returned to Italy to sign with Scavolini Pesaro in summer 1996.

He played less than usual, and finished averaging 3.5 points in the league, also scoring 14 in his first (and last) career Euroleague game, against Pau-Orthez. He returned to Imola, Legadue, for the 2004–05 season, with then a brief stay at the end of the Regular Season to play in the LEB playoffs with Polaris World Murcia.

Unfortunately, Ford had one of his worst shooting nights ever, in the semifinal against Benetton Treviso: he scored 15 points, making only 5 of his 19 shots. His 7 rebounds and 2 steals did not allow his team to overcome Benetton's obstacle, as they lost 62–65 in a highly intense game. In the Italian League 2002–03 season, Ford averaged 19.1 points per game, and Siena finished in fourth place in the league. Despite his leukemia being in an advanced stage, Ford played the Italian League 2003–04 season with Scavolini Pesaro. Averaging 22.2 points per game in the Italian League, Ford, in his final season, helped Scavolini finish in fourth place in the Italian League, which meant the team qualified to the next season's EuroLeague, and to the Italian Cup's runner-up position, despite being near death.

He also had stints with the Denver Nuggets and the Portland Trail Blazers, where he was waived for a final time in the 1997–1998 season. Askew was described as a 6-foot-6 do-everything team player who played in the post and the perimeter and was a steady defensive stopper who built a reliable jumper late in his career.

Askew also played in Italy for Serie A team Arimo Bologna (1989) and Serie A2 teams Emmezeta Udine (1990–1991) and Sidis Reggio Emilia (1992).

"" Upon his release from Portland in 1998, Askew returned to his hometown of Memphis, completed a degree in marketing and did some scouting for Memphis coach John Calipari, which piqued his interest in coaching. He confided in George Karl, his long-time mentor from his Sonics days, and was told to go overseas. Askew went to Europe, where he coached in an Italian league for three years. Askew took the head coaching job at Elliston Baptist Academy in Memphis, but was embattled to leave the job. Allegations that he had used ineligible players had landed the school in hot water with the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association, potentially costing them a chance to play in the postseason, and Askew\'s players were not pleased with his abrasive coaching methods. In 2004, Askew accepted the head coaching position at Rossville Christian Academy. Askew again stirred some controversy by recruiting players, which is a clear Mississippi Private School Association (MPSA) violation, but Askew did lead the RCA Rebels to the Class A State Championship. In 2005, he contacted the ABA expansion team Tacoma Navigators\' owner Michael Tuckman. Askew got a chance to hone his raw coaching skills, while the Navigators, which plays its home games at Mount Tahoma High School, marketed its coach as a former Sonic.

What did Michael Jackson install at his Neverland Ranch?,"['The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it as eight times Platinum in the US. In March 1988, Jackson purchased 2,700 acres (11 km2) of land near Santa Ynez, California, to build a new home, Neverland Ranch, at a cost of $17 million (equivalent to $45 million in 2024). He installed a Ferris wheel, a carousel, a movie theater and a zoo.', 'The People v. Jackson trial began on January 31, 2005, in Santa Maria, California, and lasted until the end of May. Jackson found the experience stressful and it affected his health. If convicted, he would have faced up to twenty years in prison. On June 13, 2005, Jackson was acquitted on all counts. FBI files on Jackson, released in 2009, revealed the FBI\'s role in the 2005 trial and the 1993 allegations, and showed that the FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct on Jackson\'s behalf. = After the trial, Jackson became reclusive. In June 2005, he moved to Bahrain as a guest of Sheikh Abdullah. In early 2006, it was announced that Jackson had signed a contract with a Bahrain startup, Two Seas Records. Nothing came of the deal, and the Two Seas CEO, Guy Holmes, later said it was never finalized. Holmes also found that Jackson was on the verge of bankruptcy and was involved in 47 ongoing lawsuits. By September 2006, Jackson was no longer affiliated with Two Seas. In April 2006, Jackson agreed to use a piece of his ATV catalog stake, then worth about $1 billion, as collateral against his $270 million worth of loans from Bank of America. Bank of America had sold the loans to Fortress Investments, an investment company that buys distressed loans, the year before. As part of the agreement, Fortress Investments provided Jackson a new loan of $300 million with reduced interest payments (equivalent to $470 million in 2024). Sony Music would have the option to buy half of his stake, or about 25% of the catalog, at a set price. Jackson\'s financial managers had urged him to shed part of his stake to avoid bankruptcy. The main house at Neverland Ranch was closed as a cost-cutting measure, while Jackson lived in Bahrain at the hospitality of Abdullah. At least thirty of Jackson\'s employees had not been paid on time and were owed $306,000 in back wages. Jackson was ordered to pay $100,000 in penalties. Jackson never returned to Neverland after his acquittal. In mid-2006, Jackson moved to Grouse Lodge, a residential recording studio near Rosemount, County Westmeath, Ireland. There, he began work on a new album with the American producers will.i.am and Rodney Jenkins. That November, Jackson invited an Access Hollywood camera crew into the studio in Westmeath. On November 15, Jackson briefly joined in on a performance of ""We Are the World"" at the World Music Awards in London, his last public performance, and accepted the Diamond Award for sales of 100 million records. He returned to the US in December, settling in Las Vegas. That month, he attended James Brown\'s funeral in Augusta, Georgia, where he gave a eulogy calling Brown his greatest inspiration. In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought another music publishing company, Famous Music LLC, formerly owned by Viacom. The deal gave Jackson the rights to songs by Eminem and Beck, among others. In a brief interview, Jackson said he had no regrets about his career despite his problems and ""deliberate attempts to hurt [him]"". That March, Jackson visited a US Army post in Japan, Camp Zama, to greet more than 3,000 troops and their families. As of September, Jackson was still working on his next album, which he never completed. In 2008, for the 25th anniversary of Thriller, Jackson and Sony released Thriller 25, with two remixes released as singles: ""The Girl Is Mine 2008"" and ""Wanna Be Startin\' Somethin\' 2008"". Thriller 25 was the last recorded work released during his life which he was extensively involved with, with Jackson co-producing the album\'s remix tracks. For his 50th birthday, Sony BMG released a series of greatest hits albums, King of Pop, with different tracklists for different regions. That July, Fortress Investments threatened to foreclose on Neverland Ranch, which he had used as collateral for his loans. Fortress sold Jackson\'s debts to Colony Capital LLC. In November, Jackson transferred Neverland Ranch\'s title to Sycamore Valley Ranch Company LLC, a joint venture between Jackson and Colony Capital LLC. The deal earned him $35 million.', 'T.J. Jackson, the son of Tito Jackson, was given co-guardianship of Michael Jackson\'s children after false reports of Katherine Jackson going missing. Xscape, an album of unreleased material, was released on May 13, 2014. The lead single, a duet between Jackson and Justin Timberlake, ""Love Never Felt So Good"", reached number 9 on the US Billboard Hot 100, making Jackson the first artist to have a top-10 single on the chart in five different decades. Later in 2014, Queen released a duet recorded with Jackson in the 1980s. A compilation album, Scream, was released on September 29, 2017. A jukebox musical, MJ the Musical, premiered on Broadway in 2022. Myles Frost won the 2022 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his portrayal of Jackson. On November 18, 2022, Epic released a 40th-anniversary edition reissue of Thriller. A biographical film based on Jackson\'s life, Michael, directed by Antoine Fuqua, is scheduled for October 2025. Jackson is played by his nephew Jaafar Jackson. Deadline Hollywood reported that the film ""will not shy away from the controversies of Jackson\'s life"". Since Jackson\'s death, his estate has grossed $2 billion in ticket revenue from MJ the Musical, Michael Jackson\'s This Is It and two Cirque du Soleil productions. = In 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old (1989–1996). In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck, alleging similar sexual abuse over a four-year period starting when Safechuck was ten (1988–1992). Both had previously testified in Jackson\'s defense during the 1993 allegations; Robson did so again in 2005. In 2015, Robson\'s case against Jackson\'s estate was dismissed as it had been filed too late. Safechuck\'s claim was also time-barred. In 2017, it was ruled that Jackson\'s corporations could not be held accountable for his alleged past actions. The rulings were appealed. On October 20, 2020, Safechuck\'s lawsuit against Jackson\'s corporations was again dismissed. The judge ruled that there was no evidence that Safechuck had had a relationship with Jackson\'s corporation, nor was it proven that there was a special relationship between the two. On April 26, 2021, Robson\'s case was dismissed because of a lack of supporting evidence that the defendants exercised control over Jackson. Robson and Safechuck\'s allegations were the subject of the documentary film Leaving Neverland, released in March 2019. Radio stations in New Zealand, Canada, the UK and the Netherlands removed Jackson\'s music from their playlists. Jackson\'s family condemned the film as a ""public lynching"", and the Jackson estate released a statement calling the film a ""tabloid character assassination [Jackson] endured in life, and now in death"". Close associates of Jackson, such as Corey Feldman, Aaron Carter, Brett Barnes, and Macaulay Culkin, defended Jackson in the wake of the documentary\'s release, saying that Jackson had never molested them. Documentaries such as Square One: Michael Jackson, Neverland Firsthand: Investigating the Michael Jackson Documentary and Michael Jackson: Chase the Truth, presented information countering the claims suggested by Leaving Neverland. Jackson\'s album sales increased following the documentary screenings. Billboard senior editor Gail Mitchell said she and a colleague interviewed about thirty music executives who believed Jackson\'s legacy could withstand the controversy. In late 2019, some New Zealand and Canadian radio stations re-added Jackson\'s music to their playlists, citing ""positive listener survey results"". On February 21, 2019, the Jackson estate sued HBO for breaching a non-disparagement clause from a 1992 contract. The suit sought to compel HBO to participate in a non-confidential arbitration that could result in $100 million or more in damages awarded to the estate. HBO said they did not breach a contract and filed an anti-SLAPP motion against the estate. In September 2019, Judge George H. Wu denied HBO\'s motion to dismiss the case, allowing the Jackson estate to arbitrate. HBO appealed, but in December 2020 the appeals court affirmed Wu\'s ruling. In 2020, a state law passed in California which granted plaintiffs in child sex abuse cases an additional period to file lawsuits. In October 2020 and again in April 2021, the Los Angeles County Superior Court ruled that MJJ Productions Inc. and MJJ Ventures Inc. employees were not legally obligated to protect the two men from Jackson. In August 2023, California\'s Second District Court of Appeal overturned the ruling, and the case was approved to move forward to trial court. Jackson has been referred to as the ""King of Pop"" for having transformed the art of music videos and paving the way for modern pop music. For much of Jackson\'s career, he had an unparalleled worldwide influence over the younger generation. His influence extended beyond the music industry; he impacted dance, led fashion trends, and raised awareness for global affairs. Jackson\'s music and videos fostered racial diversity in MTV\'s roster and steered its focus from rock to pop music and R&B, leading to the discontinuation of the album-oriented rock format previously dominant on the channel. In songs such as ""Black or White"", ""Heal the World"", ""Earth Song"" and ""They Don\'t Care About Us"", Jackson\'s music emphasized racial integration and environmentalism and protested injustice. He is considered one of the most significant figures of the 20th century, and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. Jackson\'s meteoric rise in the 1980s catapulted him to global stardom, and his influence transcended borders. In Africa, his influence was compared to Nelson Mandela for his ability to inspire and unite diverse audiences through his music. Similarly, in India, Jackson was likened to Mahatma Gandhi, with his art championing themes of social justice and humanitarianism, and his influence extending to Bollywood where it was said that anyone who danced well was compared to Jackson. In Europe, Jackson\'s impact was compared to that of the Pope, drawing huge crowds of people who gathered to see the singer in public and even more to his concerts, which spread messages of love and healing during rough economic and political times. His presence in the Middle East was considered as widespread as Coca-Cola, symbolizing a shared global culture through his music. Additionally, Jackson is considered the backbone of the K-pop industry in South Korea, influencing countless artists and shaping the genre\'s development.Trying to trace Michael Jackson\'s influence on the pop stars that followed him is like trying to trace the influence of oxygen and gravity. So vast, far-reaching and was his impact—particularly in the wake of Thriller\'s colossal and heretofore unmatched commercial success—that there weren\'t a whole lot of artists who weren\'t trying to mimic some of the Jackson formula.Danyel Smith, chief content officer of Vibe Media Group and the editor-in-chief of Vibe, described Jackson as ""the greatest star"". Steve Huey of AllMusic called him ""an unstoppable juggernaut, possessed of all the skills to dominate the charts seemingly at will: an instantly identifiable voice, eye-popping dance moves, stunning musical versatility and loads of sheer star power"". BET said Jackson was ""quite simply the greatest entertainer of all time"" whose ""sound, style, movement and legacy continues to inspire artists of all genres"". In 1984, Time pop critic Jay Cocks wrote that ""Jackson is the biggest thing since the Beatles. He is the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley. He just may be the most popular black singer ever."" He described Jackson as a ""star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade.', 'The documentary, broadcast in February 2003 as Living with Michael Jackson, showed Jackson holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with a twelve-year-old boy. He said that he saw nothing wrong with having sleepovers with minors and sharing his bed and bedroom with various people, which aroused controversy. He insisted that the sleepovers were not sexual and that his words had been misunderstood. In October 2003, Jackson received the Key to the City of Las Vegas from Mayor Oscar Goodman. On November 18, 2003, Sony released Number Ones, a greatest hits album. It was certified five times platinum by the RIAA, and ten times platinum in the UK, for shipments of at least 3 million units. On December 18, 2003, Santa Barbara authorities charged Jackson with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of intoxicating a minor with alcoholic drinks. Jackson denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty.', 'A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too."" The New York Times wrote ""in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else"".In November 1983, Jackson and his brothers partnered with PepsiCo in a $5 million promotional deal that broke records for a celebrity endorsement (equivalent to $15.8 million in 2024). The first Pepsi campaign, which ran in the US from 1983 to 1984 and launched its ""New Generation"" theme, included tour sponsorship, public relations events, and in-store displays. Jackson helped to create the advertisement, and suggested using his song ""Billie Jean"", with revised lyrics, as its jingle. On January 27, 1984, Michael and other members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi commercial overseen by Phil Dusenberry, a BBDO ad agency executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi\'s Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson\'s hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter. Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million (equivalent to $4.5 million in 2024) settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California; its now-closed Michael Jackson Burn Center was named in his honor. Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for $10 million (equivalent to $27.7 million in 2024). The second campaign covered 20 countries and provided financial support for Jackson\'s Bad album and 1987–1988 world tour. Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as LA Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, but none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi. The Victory Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson\'s new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did with his brothers. Following controversy over the concert\'s ticket sales, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated $3 to 5 million, to charity. During the last concert of the Victory Tour at the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, Jackson announced his split from the Jacksons during ""Shake Your Body"". = With Lionel Richie, Jackson co-wrote the charity single ""We Are the World"" (1985), which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa. It earned $63 million (equivalent to $184 million in 2024), and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with 20 million copies sold. It won four Grammy Awards in 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie. Jackson, Jones, and the promoter Ken Kragen received special awards for their roles in the song\'s creation. Jackson collaborated with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s, and learned that McCartney was making $40 million a year from owning the rights to other artists\' songs. By 1983, Jackson had begun buying publishing rights to others\' songs, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson\'s early acquisitions of music catalogs and song copyrights such as the Sly Stone collection included ""Everyday People"" (1968), Len Barry\'s ""1-2-3"" (1965), and Dion DiMucci\'s ""The Wanderer"" (1961) and ""Runaround Sue"" (1961). In 1984, Robert Holmes à Court announced he was selling the ATV Music Publishing catalog comprising the publishing rights to nearly 4,000 songs, including most of the Beatles\' material. In 1981, McCartney had been offered the catalog for £20 million ($40 million) (equivalent to $138 million in 2024). Jackson submitted a bid of $46 million (equivalent to $139 million in 2024) on November 20, 1984. When Jackson and McCartney were unable to make a joint purchase, McCartney did not want to be the sole owner of the Beatles\' songs, and did not pursue an offer on his own. Jackson\'s agents were unable to come to a deal, and in May 1985 left talks after having spent more than $1 million and four months of due diligence work on the negotiations. In June 1985, Jackson and Branca learned that Charles Koppelman\'s and Marty Bandier\'s The Entertainment Company had made a tentative offer to buy ATV Music for $50 million; in early August, Holmes à Court contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson\'s increased bid of $47.5 million (equivalent to $139 million in 2024) was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly, having already completed due diligence. Jackson agreed to visit Holmes à Court in Australia, where he would appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. His purchase of ATV Music was finalized on August 10, 1985. = Jackson\'s skin had been medium-brown during his youth, but from the mid-1980s gradually grew paler. The change drew widespread media coverage, including speculation that he had been bleaching his skin. His dermatologist, Arnold Klein, said he observed in 1983 that Jackson had vitiligo, a condition characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment. He also identified discoid lupus erythematosus in Jackson. He diagnosed Jackson with lupus that year, and with vitiligo in 1986. Vitiligo\'s drastic effects on the body can cause psychological distress. Jackson used fair-colored makeup, and possibly skin-bleaching prescription creams, to cover up the uneven blotches of color caused by the illness. The creams would depigment the blotches, and, with the application of makeup, he could appear very pale. Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and could not control his vitiligo, adding, ""When people make up stories that I don\'t want to be who I am, it hurts me."" He became friends with Klein and Klein\'s assistant, Debbie Rowe. Rowe later became Jackson\'s second wife and the mother of his first two children. In his 1988 autobiography and a 1993 interview, Jackson said he had had two rhinoplasty surgeries and a cleft chin surgery but no more than that. He said he lost weight in the early 1980s because of a change in diet to achieve a dancer\'s body. Witnesses reported that he was often dizzy, and speculated he was suffering from anorexia nervosa. Periods of weight loss became a recurring problem later in his life. After his death, Jackson\'s mother said that he first turned to cosmetic procedures to remedy his vitiligo, because he did not want to look like a ""spotted cow"". She said he had received more than the two cosmetic surgeries he claimed and speculated that he had become addicted to them. In 1986, it was reported that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow aging. He denied the story, although it was alleged that Jackson leaked an image of him sleeping in a glass chamber (according to Jackson, this was a promotional shot from an upcoming space opera featuring himself) to The National Enquirer. It was also reported that Jackson took female hormone shots to keep his voice high and facial hair wispy, proposed to Elizabeth Taylor and possibly had a shrine of her, and had cosmetic surgery on his eyes. Jackson\'s manager Frank DiLeo denied all of them, except for Jackson having a chamber. DiLeo added ""I don\'t know if he sleeps in it.', ""He spent time in the Skywalker Ranch for the movie's post-production."", ""3 (7).

In 1992, he was honored as a ""Point of Light Ambassador"" by Bush for inviting disadvantaged children to his Neverland Ranch. Jackson won hundreds of awards, making him one of the most-awarded artists in popular music. His awards include 39 Guinness World Records, including the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time, 13 Grammy Awards, as well as the Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and 26 American Music Awards, including the Artist of the Century and Artist of the 1980s. He also received the World Music Awards\' Best-Selling Male Artist of the Millennium and the Bambi Pop Artist of the Millennium Award. Jackson was inducted onto the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1980 as a member of the Jacksons, and in 1984 as a solo artist. He was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Vocal Group Hall of Fame as a member of the Jackson 5 in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and again as a solo artist in 2001. In 2002, he was added to the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2010, he was the first recording artist to be inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame, and in 2014, he was posthumously inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame. In 2021, he was among the inaugural inductees into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame. In 1988, Fisk University honored him with an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters. In 1992, he was invested as a titular king of Sanwi, a traditional kingdom located in the south-east of Ivory Coast. In July 2009, the Lunar Republic Society named a crater on the Moon after Jackson. In August, for what would have been Jackson\'s 51st birthday, Google dedicated their Google Doodle to him. In 2012, the extinct hermit crab Mesoparapylocheles michaeljacksoni was named in his honor. In 2014, the British Council of Cultural Relations deemed Jackson\'s life one of the 80 most important cultural moments of the 20th century. World Vitiligo Day has been celebrated on June 25, the anniversary of Jackson\'s death, to raise awareness of the auto-immune disorder that Jackson suffered from. In 1989, Jackson\'s annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts were estimated at $125 million.', 'In late 1995, Jackson was admitted to a hospital after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance, caused by a stress-related panic attack. In November, Jackson merged his ATV Music catalog with Sony\'s music publishing division, creating Sony/ATV Music Publishing. He retained ownership of half the company, earning $95 million up front (equivalent to $196 million in 2024) as well as the rights to more songs. ""Earth Song"" was the third single released from HIStory, and topped the UK Singles Chart for six weeks over Christmas 1995. It became the 87th-bestselling single in the UK. At the 1996 Brit Awards, Jackson\'s performance of ""Earth Song"" was disrupted by Pulp singer Jarvis Cocker, who was protesting what Cocker saw as Jackson\'s ""Christ-like"" persona. Jackson said the stage invasion was ""disgusting and cowardly"". In 1996, Jackson won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form, for ""Scream"" and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist. In July 1996, Jackson performed for Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah\'s fiftieth birthday at Jerudong Park Amphitheater, which was specifically built for that birthday concert. Jackson was reportedly paid $17 million (equivalent to $34 million in 2024). Jackson promoted HIStory with the HIStory World Tour, from September 7, 1996, to October 15, 1997. He performed 82 concerts in five continents, 35 countries and 58 cities to over 4.5 million fans, his most attended tour. It grossed $165 million (equivalent to $323 million in 2024). During the tour, in Sydney, Australia, Jackson married Debbie Rowe, a dermatology assistant, who was six months pregnant with his first child. Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. (commonly known as Prince) was born on February 13, 1997. His sister Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson was born on April 3, 1998. Jackson and Rowe divorced in 2000, Rowe conceded custody of the children, with an $8 million settlement (equivalent to $15.1 million in 2024). In 2004, after the second child abuse allegations against Jackson, she returned to court to reclaim custody.', 'R. Rahman, Prabhu Deva Sundaram, Shobana, Andrea Bocelli and Luciano Pavarotti. The proceeds went to the Nelson Mandela Children\'s Fund, the Red Cross and UNESCO. In 1999, Jackson was presented with the ""Outstanding Humanitarian Award"" at Bollywood Movie Awards in New York City where he noted Mahatma Gandhi to have been an inspiration for him. From August 1999 to 2000, he lived in New York City at 4 East 74th Street. At the turn of the century, Jackson was awarded with the Artist of the 1980s Decade Award at the 27th American Music Awards, and the Best-Selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium Award at the 12nd World Music Awards. In 2000, Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer. In September 2001, two concerts were held at Madison Square Garden to mark Jackson\'s 30th year as a solo artist. Jackson performed with his brothers for the first time since 1984. The show also featured Mýa, Usher, Whitney Houston, Destiny\'s Child, Monica, Liza Minnelli and Slash. The first show was marred by technical lapses, and the crowd booed a speech by Marlon Brando. 45 million people watched the television broadcast of the shows in November according to Nielsen Media Research. After the September 11 attacks (in which Jackson narrowly avoided death by oversleeping and missing a scheduled meeting at the World Trade Center), Jackson helped organize the United We Stand: What More Can I Give benefit concert at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., on October 21, 2001. Jackson performed ""What More Can I Give"" as the finale. The release of Invincible was preceded by a dispute between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had expected the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him in the early 2000s, after which he would be able to promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits, but clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract. Invincible was released on October 30, 2001. It was Jackson\'s first full-length album in six years, and the last album of original material he released in his lifetime. It debuted at number one in 13 countries, and went on to sell eight million copies worldwide, receiving double-platinum certification in the US. On January 9, 2002, Jackson won his 22nd American Music Award for Artist of the Century. Later that year, an anonymous surrogate mother gave birth to his third child, Prince Michael Jackson II (nicknamed ""Blanket""), who had been conceived by artificial insemination. On November 20, Jackson briefly held Blanket over the railing of his Berlin hotel room, four stories above ground level, prompting widespread criticism in the media. Jackson apologized for the incident, calling it ""a terrible mistake"". On January 22, promoter Marcel Avram filed a breach of contract complaint against Jackson for failing to perform two planned 1999 concerts. In March, a Santa Maria jury ordered Jackson to pay Avram $5.3 million (equivalent to $9.3 million in 2024). On December 18, 2003, Jackson\'s attorneys dropped all appeals on the verdict and settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount. On April 24, 2002, Jackson performed at Apollo Theater. The concert was a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and former President Bill Clinton. The money collected would be used to encourage citizens to vote. It raised $2.5 million (equivalent to $3.8 million in 2024). The concert was called Michael Jackson: Live at the Apollo and was one of Jackson\'s final on-stage performances. In July 2002, at Al Sharpton\'s National Action Network in Harlem, Jackson called the Sony Music chairman Tommy Mottola ""a racist, and very, very, very devilish"", and accused him of exploiting black artists for his own gain. The accusation prompted Sharpton to form a coalition investigating whether Mottola exploited black artists. Jackson charged that Mottola had called his colleague Irv Gotti a ""fat nigger"". Sony issued a statement calling the accusations ""ludicrous, spiteful, and hurtful"" and said Mottola had championed Jackson\'s career for years. Sony refused to renew Jackson\'s contract and said that a $25 million (equivalent to $43.7 million in 2024) promotional campaign had failed because Jackson refused to tour in the US for Invincible. = Beginning in May 2002, a documentary film crew led by Martin Bashir followed Jackson for several months.', 'Its score was arranged by Quincy Jones, who later produced three of Jackson\'s solo albums. During his time in New York, Jackson frequented the Studio 54 nightclub, where he heard early hip hop; this influenced his beatboxing on future tracks such as ""Working Day and Night"". In 1978, Jackson felt unsatisfied with his nose, and decided to have a rhinoplasty. He was referred to Steven Hoefflin, who performed his operations. Jackson\'s fifth solo album and first album as an adult, Off the Wall (1979), established him as a solo performer and helped him move from the bubblegum pop of his youth to more complex sounds. It produced four top 10 entries in the US: ""Off the Wall"", ""She\'s Out of My Life"", and the chart-topping singles ""Don\'t Stop \'Til You Get Enough"" and ""Rock with You"". The album reached number three on the US Billboard 200 and sold over 20 million copies worldwide. In 1980, Jackson won three American Music Awards for his solo work: Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist, and Favorite Soul/R&B Single for ""Don\'t Stop \'Til You Get Enough"". He also won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for 1979 with ""Don\'t Stop \'Til You Get Enough"". In 1981, Jackson was the American Music Awards winner for Favorite Soul/R&B Album and Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist. Jackson felt Off the Wall should have made a bigger impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release. In 1980, he secured the highest royalty rate in the music industry: 37 percent of wholesale album profit. = Jackson recorded with Queen\'s lead singer Freddie Mercury from 1981 to 1983, recording demos of ""State of Shock"", ""Victory"" and ""There Must Be More to Life Than This"". The recordings were intended for an album of duets but, according to Queen\'s manager Jim Beach, the relationship soured when Jackson brought a llama into the recording studio, and Jackson was upset by Mercury\'s drug use. ""There Must Be More to Life Than This"" was released in 2014. Jackson went on to record ""State of Shock"" with Mick Jagger for the Jacksons\' album Victory (1984). In 1982, Jackson contributed ""Someone in the Dark"" to the audiobook for the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Jackson\'s sixth album, Thriller, was released in late 1982. It was the bestselling album worldwide in 1983, and became the bestselling album of all time in the US and the best-selling album of all time worldwide, selling an estimated 70 million copies. It topped the Billboard 200 chart for 37 weeks and was in the top 10 of the 200 for 80 consecutive weeks. It was the first album to produce seven Billboard Hot 100 top-10 singles, including ""Billie Jean"", ""Beat It"", and ""Wanna Be Startin\' Somethin\'"".On March 25, 1983, Jackson reunited with his brothers for Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16 to an estimated audience of 47 million, and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars. Jackson\'s solo performance of ""Billie Jean"" earned him his first Emmy Award nomination. Wearing a glove decorated with rhinestones, he debuted his moonwalk dance, which Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier, and it became his signature dance in his repertoire. Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to the show, believing he had been doing too much television.', 'On July 8, 1993, Evan Chandler, Jordan\'s father and a Los Angeles dentist, was recorded threatening to ""destroy"" Jackson\'s career with a ""carefully planned plot, with people in place ready to set it in motion"" if Jackson did not meet his demands, revealing clear financial motives: ""If I go through with this, I win big-time. There’s no way I lose"". On July 9, Jackson\'s investigator, Anthony Pellicano, met Jordan, who denied any abuse or inappropriate touching by Jackson. Evan Chandler\'s lawyer would later call Beverly Hills psychiatrist Dr. Mathis Abrams and present him with a hypothetical situation. In reply and without having met either Jordan Chandler or his parents, Abrams sent Rothman a two-page letter in which he states that ""reasonable suspicion would exist that sexual abuse may have occurred"" after receiving the letter from Dr Abrams Evan Chandler allegedly received a confession from his son Jordan. Evan demands $20 million from Jackson on August 4, 1993, without going to law enforcement regarding the reports of the abuse that was claimed to have taken place, but Jackson refused and sued Chandler for extortion. Later a meeting at the Westwood Marquis Hotel, Evan and his son Jordan met Michael Jackson and Anthony Pellicano without their lawyer Barry Rothman, Evan greeted Jackson with a hug before pulling out a letter from Dr. Mathis Abrams and reading its allegations of child molestation aloud, As Evan cited the molestation references, Jordan lowered his head and then looked at Jackson with evident surprise, casting doubt on the claims as he had reportedly already reported his confession weeks prior. The encounter concluded with Evan pointing at Jackson and declaring, ""I\'m going to ruin you,"" revealing a clear intent to threaten rather than seek justice—a stark contrast to the embrace that opened the meeting. From August 9–13, 1993 Evan Chandler and his legal team made various counteroffers to secure a settlement from Jackson, escalating their financial demands after his refusal to pay the initial $20 million, with Evan later filing a civil suit in September demanding $30 million for alleged damages which were all denied by Jackson, prompting Chandler to go public with the claims of child molestation. Jackson\'s older sister La Toya accused him of being a pedophile; she later retracted this, saying she had been forced into it by her abusive husband. Prosecutors raided Neverland Ranch and other places of residency while Jackson was on tour in August, but no leads were found as the investigators ruled that there was no medical evidence or physical evidence. Additionally hundreds of children were investigated but all of them stated no abuse or improper behavior had taken place. Attention was later brought to two legal art books depicting featuring young boys playing, running, and swimming in various states of undress, however Jackson denied knowing of the books\' content and claimed if they were there, someone had to have sent them to him and he did not open them. No child pornography or other incriminating evidence was found. In December 1993, Prosecutor Tom Sneddon filed a strip search on Jackson based on the drawing obtained by Jordan Chandler which had been sent to the authorities, however the drawing did not match and prosecutors sought out Jackson\'s doctors and family inquiring about the possibility the singer had altered his genitals as to explain the mismatch. In November 1993, Jackson requested that the civil trial be postponed until after the criminal hearing was completed due to a violation of his civil rights, under the circumstances of having to defend himself under double jeopardy. This motion was denied and in January 1994 the civil lawsuit was settled for $15,331,250 with separate payments of 1.5 million for Evan and June Chandler coming out to a total of 18.3 million allocated to the Chandler family, lower than the initial demand of 20-30 million requested by Evan Chandler. The document shows that the Chandlers dropped the child molestation allegations from their complaint with Jackson\'s settlement being filed over claims of negligence. It was later revealed that this settlement did not prevent the Chandlers from testifying in the criminal case The police never pressed criminal charges. The prosecution continued to investigate Jackson from January to June 1994 with Jordan Chandler continuing to co-operate with investigators, by July 1994 multiple grand juries had been called however jurors remarked that no damaging evidence was heard against Jackson. ""The [Santa Barbara] grand jury in Michael Jackson\'s case was dismissed and one juror said he heard no evidence against [Jackson]... Another juror told CNN that he heard no evidence against him [Jackson] during the hearing."" On September 21, 1994, after 400 witnesses had been investigated with another 30 called in front of the grand juries, the investigation was closed. A few potential leads had been found but all of them turned out to be false. Jackson had been taking painkillers for his reconstructive scalp surgeries, administered due to the Pepsi commercial accident in 1984, and became dependent on them to cope with the stress of the sexual abuse allegations. On November 12, 1993, Jackson canceled the remainder of the Dangerous World Tour due to health problems, stress from the allegations and painkiller addiction. He thanked his close friend Elizabeth Taylor for support, encouragement and counsel. The end of the tour concluded his sponsorship deal with Pepsi. In late 1993, Jackson proposed to Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of Elvis Presley, over the phone. They were married in La Vega, Dominican Republic, in May 1994 by civil judge Hugo Francisco Álvarez Pérez. The tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a publicity stunt to deflect away from Jackson\'s sexual abuse allegations and jump-start Presley\'s career as a singer. Their marriage ended little more than a year later, and they separated in December 1995. Presley cited ""irreconcilable differences"" when filing for divorce the next month and only sought to reclaim her maiden name as her settlement. After the divorce, Judge Pérez said, ""They lasted longer than I thought they would. I gave them a year. They lasted a year and a half."" Presley later said she and Jackson had attempted to reconcile intermittently for four years following their divorce, and that she had traveled the world to be with him. Jackson composed music for the Sega Genesis video game Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994), but left the project around the time the sexual abuse allegations surfaced and went uncredited. Jackson\'s involvement was the subject of fan speculation for decades until Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka confirmed it in 2022. Sega Technical Institute director Roger Hector and Sonic co-creator Naoto Ohshima said that Jackson was terminated and his music reworked following the allegations. However, Jackson\'s musical director Brad Buxer and other members of Jackson\'s team said he went uncredited because he was unhappy with how the Genesis replicated his music. The game\'s credits theme served as the basis for Jackson\'s 1996 song ""Stranger in Moscow"". = In June 1995, Jackson released the double album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. The first disc, HIStory Begins, is a greatest hits album (reissued in 2001 as Greatest Hits: HIStory, Volume I). The second disc, HIStory Continues, contains 13 original songs and two cover versions. The album debuted at number one on the charts and has been certified for eight million shipments in the US. It is the bestselling multi-disc album of all time, with 20 million copies (40 million units) sold worldwide. HIStory received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. The New York Times reviewed it as ""the testimony of a musician whose self-pity now equals his talent"". The first single from HIStory was ""Scream/Childhood"". ""Scream"", a duet with Jackson\'s youngest sister Janet, protests the media\'s treatment of Jackson during the 1993 child abuse allegations against him. The single reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100, and received a Grammy nomination for ""Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals"".', 'Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the ""King of Pop"", he is regarded as one of the most culturally significant figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his music achievements broke racial barriers in America and made him a dominant figure across the world. Through songs, stages, and fashion, he proliferated visual performance for artists in popular music; popularizing street dance moves including the moonwalk, the robot, and the anti-gravity lean. Jackson is often deemed the greatest entertainer of all time based on his acclaim and records. The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his public debut in 1964 at age six, as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). After signing with Motown in 1968, the band achieved worldwide success with him as its lead singer. Jackson achieved solo stardom with the release of his fifth album Off the Wall (1979). He followed it up with Thriller (1982), the best-selling album of all time, which catapulted him to a rare level of fame, whilst aiding in the popularization of MTV and revolutionizing the music video medium with the videos for its title track along with ""Beat It"" and ""Billie Jean"". Jackson furthered his position as a global superstar with Bad (1987), the world\'s best-selling album of both 1987 and 1988, as well as the first album to produce five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: ""I Just Can\'t Stop Loving You"", ""Bad"", ""The Way You Make Me Feel"", ""Man in the Mirror"", and ""Dirty Diana"". Dangerous (1991) marked a new era for Jackson, lauded as his most artistic and socially conscious album. HIStory (1995) produced ""You Are Not Alone"", the first song to debut at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. His final album, Invincible, was released in 2001. From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. He was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend in 1993. In 2005, Jackson was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and all other charges. While preparing for This Is It (a series of comeback concerts), Jackson died in 2009 from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson\'s death triggered reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music. His televised memorial service, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was estimated to have been viewed by more than 2.5 billion people. Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 500 million records worldwide. He had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles (the fifth-highest in Hot 100 history) and is the first artist to have a top-ten single on the chart in five different decades. Jackson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice), the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Dance Hall of Fame (the only recording artist to be inducted). One of the most-awarded artists in popular music, his accolades include 13 Grammy Awards, the Grammy Legend Award, and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award; 26 American Music Awards, including Artist of the Century; 12 World Music Awards; six Brit Awards; the Bambi Pop Artist of the Millennium Award; and three presidential honors. In 1992, Jackson founded Heal the World Foundation, donating an estimated $500 million to charity throughout his lifetime. In 2024, half of his music catalogue sold to Sony for $600 million, the largest music acquisition for a single artist in history. = Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet, cello, and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah\'s Witness. His father, Joseph Walter ""Joe"" Jackson, was a former boxer, crane operator at US Steel, and guitarist for local rhythm and blues band the Falcons. Joe\'s great-grandfather, July ""Jack"" Gale, was a US Army scout; family lore held that he was also a Native American medicine man. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon\'s twin Brandon, died shortly after his birth. In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine. Michael said his father told him he had a ""fat nose"", and physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to punish any mistakes. Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael. Katherine said that although whipping came to be considered abuse, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon denied that their father was abusive and said that the whippings, which had a deeper impact on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. Michael said that during his youth he was lonely and isolated. Later in 1965, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group\'s name was changed to the Jackson 5. In 1965, the group won a talent show; Michael performed the dance to Robert Parker\'s 1965 song ""Barefootin\'"" and sang the Temptations\' ""My Girl"". From 1966 to 1968, the Jacksons 5 toured the Midwest; they frequently played at a string of black clubs known as the Chitlin\' Circuit as the opening act for artists such as Sam & Dave, the O\'Jays, Gladys Knight and Etta James. The Jackson 5 also performed at clubs and cocktail lounges, where striptease shows were featured, and at local auditoriums and high school dances. In August 1967, while touring the East Coast, they won a weekly amateur night concert at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. The Jackson 5 recorded several songs for a Gary record label, Steeltown Records; their first single, ""Big Boy"", was released in 1968. Bobby Taylor of Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers brought the Jackson 5 to Motown after they opened for Taylor at Chicago\'s Regal Theater in 1968. Taylor produced some of their early Motown recordings, including a version of ""Who\'s Lovin\' You"". After signing with Motown, the Jackson family relocated to Los Angeles. In 1969, Motown executives decided Diana Ross should introduce the Jackson 5 to the public — partly to bolster her career in television — sending off what was considered Motown\'s last product of its ""production line"". The Jackson 5 made their first television appearance in 1969 in the Miss Black America pageant, performing a cover of ""It\'s Your Thing"". Rolling Stone later described the young Michael as ""a prodigy"" with ""overwhelming musical gifts"" who ""quickly emerged as the main draw and lead singer"". In January 1970, ""I Want You Back"" became the first Jackson 5 song to reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100; it stayed there for four weeks. Three more singles with Motown topped the chart: ""ABC"", ""The Love You Save"", and ""I\'ll Be There"". In May 1971, the Jackson family moved into a large house at Hayvenhurst, a 2-acre (0.81 ha) estate in Encino, California. During this period, Michael developed from a child performer into a teen idol. Between 1972 and 1975, he released four solo studio albums with Motown: Got to Be There (1972), Ben (1972), Music & Me (1973) and Forever, Michael (1975). ""Got to Be There"" and ""Ben"", the title tracks from his first two solo albums, sold well as singles, as did a cover of Bobby Day\'s ""Rockin\' Robin"". Michael maintained ties to the Jackson 5.', '2 on the charts in 1992. Jackson founded the Heal the World Foundation in 1992. The charity brought underprivileged children to Jackson\'s ranch to use the theme park rides, and sent millions of dollars around the globe to help children threatened by war, poverty, and disease. That July, Jackson published his second book, Dancing the Dream, a collection of poetry. The Dangerous World Tour ran between June 1992 and November 1993 and grossed $100 million (equivalent to $220 million in 2024); Jackson performed for over 3.5 million people in 70 concerts, all of which were outside the US. Part of the proceeds went to Heal the World Foundation. Jackson sold the broadcast rights of the tour to HBO for $20 million (equivalent to $45 million in 2024), a record-breaking deal that still stands. Following the death of HIV/AIDS spokesperson and friend Ryan White, Jackson pleaded with the Clinton administration at Bill Clinton\'s inaugural gala to give more money to HIV/AIDS charities and research and performed ""Gone Too Soon"", a song dedicated to White, and ""Heal the World"" at the gala. Jackson visited Africa in early 1992; on his first stop in Gabon he was greeted by more than 100,000 people, some of them carrying signs that read ""Welcome Home Michael"", and was awarded an Officer of the National Order of Merit from President Omar Bongo. During his trip to Ivory Coast, Jackson drew larger crowds than Pope John Paul II on his previous visits. He was crowned ""King Sani"" by a tribal chief in the Ivorian village of Krindjabo, where he thanked the dignitaries in French and English, signed documents formalizing his kingship, and sat on a golden throne while presiding over ceremonial dances. In January 1993, Jackson performed at the Super Bowl XXVII halftime show in Pasadena, California. The NFL sought a big-name artist to keep ratings high during halftime following dwindling audience figures. With 133.4 million viewers, it was the first Super Bowl whose halftime show drew greater audience figures than the game. Jackson played ""Jam"", ""Billie Jean"", ""Black or White"", and ""Heal the World"". Dangerous rose 90 places in the US albums chart after the performance. Jackson gave a 90-minute interview with Oprah Winfrey on February 10, 1993.', 'On the same trip, he appeared in Glasgow with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, speaking in support of Searchlight magazine\'s anti racism campaign, the Daily Mirror ""Hope Not Hate Bus"". On November 23, 2007, Jackson appeared on Katie & Peter: Unleashed and again talked of a reunion with his brothers on a tour the following year. In 2008, Jackson flew to Australia to be a guest judge and mentor for the top-five Michael Jackson night on Australian Idol. In March 2008, Jackson was the guest of honor at the Muslim Writers Awards in Birmingham. In 2009, following his brother Michael\'s passing, Jermaine appeared on the A&E television series The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty, documenting what was supposed to be a 40th-anniversary reunion between Jermaine and his brothers. The series lasted one season and Jermaine, along with his three brothers, was listed as an executive producer. In October 2010, Jermaine played a concert at the Planet Hollywood hotel and casino in Las Vegas, naming it ""40 Years of Jackson Music"" and dedicating the concert to Michael. He wrote the memoir You Are Not Alone: Michael Through a Brother\'s Eyes (2011). In a 2012 interview with Luka Neskovic, for The Huffington Post, Jackson said that his brother planned a reunion with him: ""... the plan was to do some shows with the brothers, as well, after he finished his commitment with the This Is It [concert], and we probably gonna do some songs with him on the This Is It tour"". In October 2012, Jackson released I Wish You Love, his first solo album in 21 years, consisting mostly of jazz covers. The album was arranged and produced by French opera singer David Serero, who recorded a duet on ""Autumn Leaves"" with Jermaine, and was released by David Serero Productions. They both performed You Are Not Alone: The Musical, written, directed and produced by Serero, in France in January 2013. The following year, You Are Not Alone: The Musical Live was released on video and audio. = Jackson has been married and divorced three times, and has seven children. His first marriage was to Hazel Gordy, the daughter of Motown founder Berry Gordy. The couple were married from 1973 to 1988. They had three children; Jermaine La Jaune ""Jay"" Jackson Jr. (born 1977), Autumn Joi Jackson (born 1978) and Jaimy Jermaine Jackson (born 1987).

Jermaine supported his brother, Michael, during his 2005 trial. He came to Michael\'s defense on CNN\'s Larry King Live and appeared with him in court on many occasions. Jermaine announced his brothers\'s death on 25 June 2009 at a press conference at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.

He was the third Trail Blazer to win the award, the first two being Geoff Petrie and Sidney Wicks. 2007–08 season: First All-Star selection Roy started in the first 48 games of the 2007–08 season, averaging 19.1 points, 5.8 assists and 4.6 rebounds. He also led the Blazers to a 13-game winning streak in the month of December. Roy was selected as a reserve for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game. He scored 18 points in that game, and also had 9 rebounds. He injured his right ankle in the final game before the All-Star Weekend. Although he earned accolades for his play over the weekend, the injury impacted his play in the following weeks. He played in the Rookie Challenge for the second time, this time as a ""sophomore""; teammate LaMarcus Aldridge was also on the sophomore squad. Roy played about 29 minutes in the All-Star game, the most of any Western Conference player. He also tied Chris Paul and Amar\'e Stoudemire for the most points with 18. 2008–09 season: First All-NBA selection In the 2008 preseason, Roy underwent a 20-minute medical procedure in Vancouver, Washington, during which team physician Don Roberts removed a piece of cartilage that was causing irritation in Roy\'s left knee. Roy missed several weeks of action because of the rehabilitation, but was ready on the opening day of the season against the Los Angeles Lakers. On November 6, against the Houston Rockets, Roy hit a game-winning 30-foot jumper in overtime with eight tenths of a second left. On December 18, Roy scored a career-high 52 points against the Phoenix Suns. He made 14 of 27 shots from the field, 19 of 21 from the free-throw line, and 5 of 7 from the three-point line.

As of February 16, 2009, Roy has had 24 shots which tied or won the games with 35 seconds or less. Roy was again selected as a reserve in the 2009 NBA All-Star Game, where he scored 14 points in 7-for-8 shooting, grabbed 5 boards, and dished out 5 assists in a game-high 31 minutes of action. On April 13, Roy was named Western Conference Player of the Week for his fourth time. At the time, Clyde Drexler was the only other Portland Trail Blazers to have won the award four times. Roy finished 9th in MVP voting for the 2008–09 season, garnering one 4th-place vote and four 5th-place votes for a total of 7 points. Roy was named to the All-NBA Second Team on May 13, and was the first Blazer to make an All-NBA team since the 1991–92 season. 2009–10 season: Second All-NBA selection On August 5, 2009, it was confirmed that Roy had agreed to a four-year maximum-salary contract with a fifth-year player option, keeping him a Trail Blazer until at least the 2013–14 season. Roy was selected to compete in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game, marking his third selection as an NBA All-Star. However, Roy was sidelined because of a right hamstring injury he sustained on January 13 against the Milwaukee Bucks, and re-aggravated on January 20 against the Philadelphia 76ers. On April 11, 2010, Roy injured his right knee. Magnetic resonance imaging that night confirmed a right knee bone contusion (bone bruise) and on April 12, further examination of the MRI showed a slight meniscus tear. Roy underwent surgery on April 16 and was expected to miss at least the first round of the 2010 NBA playoffs, but returned for Game 4 after eight days of recovery time to lead the Blazers to a win. Roy was named to the All-NBA Third Team on May 6, and this was his second season in a row to be named to an All-NBA Team. Shortly before the next season began, conference rival Kobe Bryant called Roy the hardest player to guard in the Western Conference, claiming he had ""no weaknesses in his game."" Roy was the cover athlete for NBA 10: The Inside. 2010–11 season: Final season in Portland Roy started the first month of the season scoring at his normal rate, but by December it started showing that his knees, which have bothered him since college and were injured in April, were ailing due to lack of cartilage. He missed nine games before the Trail Blazers announced that he would be out indefinitely. On January 17, 2011, Roy underwent arthroscopic surgery on both of his knees. He returned to the lineup on February 25, scoring 18 points off the bench, including a clutch three-pointer to force overtime, and helping the Blazers defeat the Denver Nuggets 107–106. The Blazers then faced the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the 2011 NBA playoffs. Roy shot 1-for-8 the first 2 games, including a Game 2 where he saw only 8 minutes of playing time and went scoreless. The Blazers lost both games and trailed 2-0 in the series. He expressed his frustration about being the last substitution during the first 2 quarters, and playing for 8 minutes after getting 26 minutes in Game 1. Both the Blazers and Mavericks started Game 4 with a quiet first half, with Dallas leading slightly. The Blazers then missed their first 15 shots after halftime as the Mavs\' lead grew as big as 67–44. Roy then made a three-pointer near the end of the third to cut the lead to 67–49. In the fourth quarter, Roy scored 18 points after going 1-for-3 the previous 3 quarters, including a clutch 4-point play to tie the game and a bank shot from the middle of the paint with 49 seconds left to give his team the lead for good, finishing with 24 points to lead the Blazers to an improbable 84–82 win to tie the series. Just before NBA training camp opened following the resolution of the 2011 NBA lockout, Roy announced that his knees had degenerated so much—he lacked cartilage between the bones of both knees—that he was retiring from basketball. Following his announcement of retirement, the Portland Trail Blazers used their amnesty clause on Roy for salary cap flexibility. = In June 2012, Roy announced that he was planning to make a comeback to the NBA. He said he had recovered enough to play after having the platelet-rich plasma procedure that Kobe Bryant also had to keep his knees healthy. He could not play for Portland under the current NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement because of Portland\'s amnesty of him in 2011. Roy entered the free agent market on July 1, 2012. Roy reportedly had expressed interest in signing with the Dallas Mavericks, Golden State Warriors, Minnesota Timberwolves, Indiana Pacers, or Chicago Bulls. On July 31, 2012, Roy signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves. The deal put Roy with All-Star forward Kevin Love and point guard Ricky Rubio. He decided to wear No.', 'Louis, Illinois.

Mike Jarvis, the head coach for the Red Storm at the time, has stated that Miles\' commitment significantly helped obtain Cook and the other incoming freshmen from the recruiting class. = Miles entered the 2000 NBA draft and was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers as the third overall pick, at the time the highest a player had been drafted directly from high school. His debut game was played on October 31, 2000, in a 94–107 loss to the Utah Jazz where he recorded eight points, seven rebounds, two assists and two blocks. For the next two seasons Miles, Quentin Richardson, Corey Maggette, Lamar Odom and Elton Brand entertained fans with their exciting, high flying style of play. He played his first two seasons with the Clippers, earning an NBA All-Rookie Team first team honor in 2001. In those years Miles, Richardson, and others helped the Clippers improve their performance from 15 wins in 99–00, to 31 wins in 00–01 to finally 39 wins in 01–02. In the 2001–02 season, the Clippers appeared to be on the verge of their first playoff appearance since 1997; however, they were only able to win three of the last 12 games of the season, ultimately finishing five games out of the playoffs. = Following the 2001–2002 season, Miles was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers, alongside Harold Jamison, in a deal for Andre Miller and Bryant Stith where he spent a season and a half before being traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for Jeff McInnis and Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje midway through the 2003–04 season. = During the 2004–05 season, Miles made headlines after a confrontation with then-coach Maurice Cheeks in which Miles reportedly insulted Cheeks with racial slurs and remarked he ""did not care if the team were to lose the next 20 games"" since Cheeks was ""going to be fired anyway"". According to ESPN\'s Chad Ford and other accounts, after Cheeks asked Miles to leave, Miles\' response was ""Make me."" When Cheeks left the room to see Blazers\' general manager John Nash, Miles ran behind him shouting, ""That\'s right, run to your daddy."" On April 19, 2005, he scored a career-high 47 points in a loss against the Denver Nuggets, which equaled the eighth-highest single-game output in franchise history up to that point. Late in the 2005–2006 season, Miles severely injured his right knee.', 'Richard died during a game in 1991 after suffering an aneurysm.

As a youngster, Nicolas Batum was considered one of the most talented young players in Europe, as he was ranked #17 among international players born in 1988, by the scouting website DraftExpress.com at the time he entered the 2008 NBA draft. = Batum was part of the junior French national team that won the 2004 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship. He was named the MVP of the 2006 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship, as France won the gold medal at that tournament. While playing for Le Mans, Batum averaged 3.4 points (65.9% FG), 2.5 rebounds, 0.5 assist per game in 13 minutes for the 2006–2007 French league season, and 12.3 points (52.3%), 5.0 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game in 28 minutes for the 2007–2008 season. = Upon being selected with the 25th pick in the 2008 NBA draft by the Houston Rockets, Batum was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for the rights to Darrell Arthur and Joey Dorsey. After coming off the bench for the first three games of his NBA career, Batum moved into the starting lineup in place of Travis Outlaw in Portland\'s fourth game of the 2008–09 season, a 103–96 loss to the Utah Jazz. On March 13, 2009, Batum recorded a season-high 20 points to go along with a clutch three-pointer with 29.9 seconds left, en route to a 109–100 victory over the New Jersey Nets. Batum missed the first 45 games of the 2009–10 season due to torn cartilage in his right shoulder. He played in his first game of the season on January 25, 2010. Batum scored more than 30 points for the first time with a 31-point performance (including 7 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 steals) on February 27, 2010, against the Minnesota Timberwolves. = In August 2011, during the 2011 NBA lockout, he signed a one-year contract with SLUC Nancy in French Basketball League which was valid until the NBA lockout ended. = Batum returned to Portland after the lockout ended. On June 25, 2012, the Portland Trail Blazers extended a qualifying offer to Batum, making him a restricted free agent. Less than three weeks later Batum signed a $46 million/4 year offer sheet with the Minnesota Timberwolves. On July 18, 2012, the Trail Blazers elected to match the Timberwolves\' offer, signing Batum to the team through the 2015–16 campaign. On November 16, 2012, Batum tied a career-high of 35 points in a 119–117 overtime win against the Houston Rockets. This was followed exactly one month later by a game in which Batum recorded the 15th ""five-by-five"" in the NBA since the 1985–86 season, and the first since Andrei Kirilenko in January 2006. In this effort Batum scored 11 points while racking up 10 assists, 5 rebounds, 5 blocks and 5 steals in a 95–94 win against the New Orleans Hornets. On January 21, 2013, Batum recorded his first triple-double in a 98–95 loss to the Washington Wizards, scoring 12 points and adding 10 rebounds, and 11 assists, in addition to 3 steals and 2 blocks.

His biggest improvement was his passing; he averaged 4.9 assists, more than triple his previous career-high (1.5 assists per game during the 2010–11 season). = On June 24, 2015, Batum was traded to the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Gerald Henderson, Jr. and Noah Vonleh. On August 1, 2015, Batum played for Team Africa at the 2015 NBA Africa exhibition game.

He was later ruled unlikely to play at all in the 2014–15 season due to the broken navicular bone in his foot. After missing the entire 2014–15 season, it was announced on 13 June 2015 that Embiid had suffered a setback in his recovery after a CT scan revealed less healing than anticipated. It was later determined that Embiid's chances of playing in the 2015–16 season were slim following a second round of surgery on his right foot on 18 August 2015. He missed the entire 2015–16 season. 2016–17 season: All-Rookie honors On 4 October 2016, Embiid started at center in the 76ers' first preseason game against the Boston Celtics. In his first action, he recorded six points, four rebounds and two blocks in 13 minutes en route to a 92–89 victory. On 26 October 2016, Embiid made his long-awaited NBA regular-season debut in the 76ers' season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder. In 25 minutes as the starting center, he recorded 20 points, seven rebounds and two blocks in a 103–97 loss.

His postseason averages went up to 23.6 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. In the first playoff series of his NBA career, Portland lost to Utah in five games. Sabonis averaged 16.0 points, 10.0 rebounds, and 3.0 assists per game in 1997–98, all career-highs. During Sabonis\'s first stint in Portland, the Blazers always made the playoffs (part of a 21-year streak); between 1998 and 1999, the Oregon franchise changed large parts of its roster in order to compete for the NBA Championship (after six consecutive first round losses) with center Sabonis the only player remaining in the starting five. Kenny Anderson and Isaiah Rider were traded for Damon Stoudamire and Steve Smith. In both those years, the Blazers reached the Western Conference Finals. In 1999, they were swept by the eventual champions, the San Antonio Spurs, while, the next year, the team (starting Sabonis, Smith, Stoudamire, Rasheed Wallace, and recently added Scottie Pippen) lost to the Los Angeles Lakers (at the beginning of the team\'s three-peat), in seven games. The question that frequently surrounds Sabonis\'s NBA career revolves around how good he could have been had he played in the NBA during his prime. Sabonis was already 30 when he joined the Blazers, by which time he had already won multiple gold medals, suffered through numerous injuries, and had lost much of his mobility and athleticism. In Bill Simmons\'s ""Book of Basketball"", Sabonis the international player is idealized, while Sabonis the Blazer is described as ""lumbering up and down the court in what looked to be concrete Nikes"" and ranking ""just behind Artis Gilmore on the Moving Like a Mummy Scale."" In ESPN\'s David Thorpe\'s view, Sabonis would be the best passing big man in NBA history, and possibly a top-four center overall, had he played his entire career there. In Clyde Drexler\'s view, if Sabonis had been able to spend his prime in Portland, next to the plethora of other Trail Blazers\' All-Stars (Drexler, Terry Porter, Buck Williams, Steve Johnson, Kevin Duckworth, and Clifford Robinson), the Trail Blazers would ""have had four, five or six titles.', ""He then, in 2012, transferred to UNLV, where he played with the UNLV Runnin' Rebels.

In a televised interview following the game, when asked by a reporter about a spontaneous ""Will Barton"" chant that had broken out late in the contest, the guard replied, ""I like to think I\'m the people\'s champ,"" thereby instantly giving birth to a new nickname and a Trail Blazers meme. He went on to record 17 points and six rebounds on May 12 to help Portland win Game 4 of their semi-final match-up against the San Antonio Spurs. = On February 19, 2015, Barton was traded, along with Víctor Claver, Thomas Robinson and a lottery-protected 2016 first-round pick, to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for Arron Afflalo and Alonzo Gee.

Petrović was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007. The 2010 documentary, Once Brothers (part of the ESPN 30 for 30 series), portrays the achievements of the Yugoslavia national basketball team in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and how the Yugoslav Wars tore the team apart. It explores Petrović\'s broken friendship with Serbian/Yugoslav player Vlade Divac. In 2011, a statue of him as a little boy sitting on a bench with a ball was unveiled in Šibenik, and his old room was renovated the way it looked when he was young, as a first part of opening a Memorial Center in his hometown. During the 2012 Three Point Shootout, New Jersey Nets guard Anthony Morrow wore Petrović\'s jersey in the latter\'s honor. In 2015, Australian writer Todd Spehr released a 470-page biography on Petrović, titled Dražen: The Remarkable Life & Legacy of the Mozart of Basketball. At the urging of the Petrovic family, Spehr\'s book was released in the Croatian language in 2016 at the Petrovic Museum, and is considered the definitive work on his life. On 3 June 2015, Croatian basketball journalists Marjan Crnogaj and Vlado Radicevic released a 487-page biography, the global paperback edition of which was released on 14 October 2017. = ""It\'s hard for you to imagine here in America, because you have so many great players, but we are a country of four million; without him, basketball takes three steps back."" ""You know, there is a saying that we have about JFK, John F. Kennedy – \'You know, Johnny, we never got to know you.\' And I kind of feel that way about Dražen. I felt that the whole year that I was with him went by too fast and I really never got to know him the way I would have liked to."" ""Dražen and I were very good friends.

A shooting guard, he initially achieved success playing professional basketball in Europe in the 1980s with Cibona and Real Madrid before joining the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1989. A star on multiple international basketball stages, Petrović earned two silver medals (1988, 1992) and one bronze (1984) at the Summer Olympic Games, a gold (1990) and a bronze (1986) at the FIBA World Cup, and a gold (1989) and a bronze (1987) at the FIBA EuroBasket. He was the FIBA World Championship MVP in 1986 and the FIBA EuroBasket MVP in 1989. With Cibona Zagreb, Petrović also won two consecutive EuroLeague championships in 1985 and 1986. He first represented Yugoslavia\'s senior national team and later Croatia\'s senior national team. He earned four Euroscars and was named Mr. Europa twice. In 1985, he received the Golden Badge award for the best athlete of Yugoslavia. Seeking a bigger arena after his career started in Europe, Petrović joined the NBA in 1989, as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers. After playing mostly off the bench that year, Petrović experienced a breakthrough following a trade to the New Jersey Nets. While starting for the Nets, he became one of the league\'s best shooting guards. He was named one of FIBA\'s 50 Greatest Players in 1991. On 7 June 1993, Petrović\'s career and life were cut short after he died in a car accident in Germany at the age of 28. In 1993, Petrović\'s jersey number 3 was retired by the Nets, and the Dražen Petrović Basketball Hall was named in his honor. He also received the Olympic Order in 1993. In 2002, he was posthumously enshrined into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In 2006, the Dražen Petrović Award was created in his honor. In 2007, he was posthumously inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame. He was named one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors in 2008. In 2013, he was voted the best European Basketball player in history, by players at the 2013 FIBA EuroBasket. Petrović is considered a crucial part of the vanguard to the present-day mass influx of European players into the NBA, and to this day he is viewed as a national hero in Croatia. Born in Šibenik, Yugoslavia (present-day Croatia), Dražen Petrović was the second child of Jovan ""Jole"" Petrović, a police officer, and Biserka (née Mikulandra), a librarian. His father was born in a Serb family in Zagora, near Trebinje in Bosnia and Herzegovina. His mother was born in Bilice, near Šibenik, and was from a traditional conservative Croat family, devoutly Catholic. The couple\'s eldest child, Aleksandar, was the first to play basketball and rose to become one of the top point guards in the former Yugoslavia. The Petrović brothers are second cousins to the Serbian basketball player Dejan Bodiroga. = At the age of 13, Petrović started playing in the youth selections of the local club Šibenka; at the age of 15, he had already made the club\'s first team, just as Šibenka had earned a place in the Yugoslav national first division. With young Petrović as the star of the team, Šibenka reached the final of the third level Pan-European club competition, the FIBA Korać Cup twice (1981–82 and 1982–83), where they lost to the French League club Limoges CSP both times. In 1983, the 18-year-old Petrović hit two free throws in Šibenka\'s victory over Bosna Sarajevo in the final playoff game of the Yugoslavian League\'s 1982–83 season\'s club championship. However, on the day after the club won the championship, the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia stripped the title from Šibenka, because of irregularities in refereeing. The league\'s championship was then awarded to Bosna, after Šibenka refused to play in a rematch. Petrović increased his scoring numbers in each successive season that he played with Šibenka. In the 1979–80 Yugoslav FFL season, he scored 13 points in 16 games, for an average of 0.8 points per game. In the 1980–81 Yugoslav FFL season, he scored 39 points in 20 games, for an average of 2.0 points per game. In the 1981–82 Yugoslav FFL season, he scored 392 points in 24 games, for an average of 16.3 points per game. In the 1982–83 Yugoslav FFL season, he scored 758 points in 31 games, for an average of 24.5 points per game. In total, he scored 1,202 points in 91 games played with Šibenka in the Yugoslav first division, for a scoring average of 13.2 points per game. = 1984–85 season After a year\'s mandatory service in the Yugoslav military, Petrović joined his older brother Aco and moved to Cibona Zagreb, to form what was at that time, the best back court duo in Europe. In his first season in Cibona, Petrović won both the national Yugoslav League championship and the Yugoslav National Cup title. In national domestic league play, in the 1984–85 Yugoslav FFL season, Petrović averaged 32.5 points per game. On 6 December 1984, in the 1984–85 season of Europe\'s top-level club competition, the FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague), Petrović scored 44 points in a game against the Spanish League club Real Madrid. He scored 29 of the 44 points in the second half of the game. Petrović also scored 36 points in the league\'s 1985 Final against Real Madrid. Cibona won the game, by a score of 87–78, and the win brought the club their first top-tier level European Champions Cup title. That season, Petrović scored a total of 463 points in 15 games played, for a scoring average of 30.9 points per game. 1985–86 season On 5 October 1985, in a Yugoslav First Federal League game against Union Olimpija Ljubljana, Petrović scored 112 points, in Cibona\'s 158–77 blowout win. He scored 67 of the 112 points in the first half of the game. During the game, Petrović shot 40/60 from the field, 10/20 from 3-point range, and 22/22 from the free-throw line. The 112 points scored was the most points ever scored in a single game in the history of the Yugoslav First Federal League. It broke the league\'s previous single-game scoring record of 74 points, which was set in 1962, by Radivoj Korać. Korać achieved that record while playing with OKK Beograd, in a game against Mladost Zagreb. Olimpija Ljubljana had failed to fulfill their player registration administrative obligations in time for the game. Olimpija general manager Radovan Lorbek was reportedly late with submitting a registration letter to the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia (KSJ) headquarters in Belgrade. That rendered their entire men\'s first team roster ineligible for the Yugoslav First Federal League\'s regular season opening game, and forced them to instead field players for the game from their youth systems. Olimpija didn\'t have an under-18 youth squad that season so the club went to Zagreb to play the game with younger players. in the under-16 and under-17 age groups, which included: Igor Đurović, Matjaž Strmole, Jože Maček, Dag Kralj, Tine Erjavec, Jure Zorčič, Gregor Stražiščar, Andrej Novina, and Tine Merzelj. Cibona, for their part, decided to use a mixed roster for the game, consisting of players from their youth system, plus their senior men\'s team\'s twenty-one-year-old Dražen Petrović, who broke Korać\'s single-game Yugoslav League scoring record of 74 points. Petrović scored 112 points in the game; before the game, he had reportedly announced his intention to leave the game once he had surpassed Korać\'s 74 points record. Petrović was one of only five Cibona players to score that day. From November 1985, Petrović began partnering in the backcourt with another high-scoring player, newly arrived shooting guard Danko Cvjetićanin, brought in as replacement for Aco Petrović who was away serving his mandatory Yugoslav People\'s Army (JNA) stint. Overall, over the 1985–86 Yugoslav League regular season and playoffs, Petrović scored a total of 1,241 points in 30 games played, for a scoring average of 41.4 points per game. That season, Petrović also won another Yugoslav National Cup title with Cibona. On 7 February 1986, Petrović scored 55 points in a Yugoslav Cup game against Union Olimpija Ljubljana. He also scored 46 points in the 1986 Yugoslav Cup\'s Final against Cibona\'s old rivals Bosna Sarajevo. On 4 December 1985, in a 1985–86 season FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) game against the Israeli Super League club Maccabi Tel Aviv, Petrović scored 44 points. In the same European Champions Cup season, on 11 December 1985, he had 47 points and 25 assists in a game against the then reigning Italian League champions Simac Milano. In another European Champions Cup game that season, on 16 January 1986, Petrović scored 49 points, and had 20 assists against the Spanish League club Real Madrid. On 22 January 1986, in a European Champions Cup game against the French League club Limoges, Petrović made ten 3-pointers, including seven in a row during a first-half stretch, for a final tally of 51 points and 10 assists in the game. The 51 points scored was also his personal career-high scored in a single EuroLeague game. Petrović won his second straight FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) title with Cibona, as he scored 22 points in the league\'s 1986 Final, in which Cibona defeated the USSR Premier League club Žalgiris Kaunas, which starred Arvydas Sabonis. In the 1985–86 European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) season, Petrović scored a total of 555 points in 15 games played, for a scoring average of 37.0 points per game. The season ended with Cibona losing the Yugoslav league playoff final series to KK Zadar. Following an opening game win, Petrović controversially sat out game 2 away in Zadar, ostensibly due to a pre-game warm-up injury, leading to accusations of tanking out of desire to win the title on home court in front of their own fans. Cibona lost game 2 thus setting up the deciding game 3 at home in Zagreb at the sold out Dom sportova. However, in one of the biggest upsets in Yugoslav League history, despite having a double-digit lead in the second half, Cibona ended up losing game 3 in double overtime with Petrović fouling out during first overtime with 39 points scored. 1986–87 season In the 1986–87 Yugoslav FFL season, Petrović scored a total of 932 points in 25 games played, for a scoring average of 37.3 points per game. In that same season, Cibona competed in the European-wide secondary level FIBA European Cup Winners\' Cup competition. Petrović led Cibona to the championship, as he scored 28 points against the Italian League club Scavolini Pesaro, in the league\'s 1986–87 season Final. It was the third straight European-wide club championship for Petrović and Cibona. In the 1986–87 FIBA European Cup Winners Cup season, Petrović scored a total of 270 points in 8 games played, for a scoring average of 33.8 points per game. 1987–88 season With Cibona, Petrović again won the Yugoslav National Cup title in 1988. In the 1987–88 Yugoslav FFL season, Petrović scored a total of 860 points in 24 games played, for a scoring average of 35.8 points per game. In that same season, Cibona competed in Europe\'s third-level club competition, the FIBA Korać Cup. On 14 October 1987, Petrović scored 62 points in a 1987–88 FIBA Korać Cup season game against the Finnish League club KTP Kotka. Petrović led Cibona to the Finals of the Korać Cup, where they lost to the Spanish League club Real Madrid. During the Korać Cup season, Petrović scored a total of 401 points in 12 games played, for a scoring average of 33.4 points per game. During his four seasons with Cibona, Petrović scored a total of 3,911 points, in 106 games played in the national Yugoslav First Federal League, for a scoring average of 36.9 points per game. With Cibona, he also scored a total of 559 points, in 20 games played, for a scoring average of 28.0 points per game, in the Yugoslav Cup competition. In the three Pan-European club competitions that he played in with Cibona, he scored a total of 1,689 points in 50 games played, for a scoring average of 33.8 points per game. With both Šibenka and Cibona, Petrović\'s career scoring numbers in the Yugoslav First Federal League were 5,113 points scored, in 197 games played, for a career scoring average of 26.0 points per game. In the FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague), Petrović scored a career total of 1,018 points in 30 games played, for a career scoring average of 33.9 points per game. = After his string of very successful seasons with Cibona Zagreb, Petrović needed new challenges that Cibona and the Yugoslav First Federal League could no longer offer him. The NBA\'s Portland Trail Blazers had already used their third-round draft pick on the young Petrović, in the 1986 NBA draft, but he had decided to postpone his departure to the United States. In 1988, rather than go to the NBA, he instead signed with the Spanish League club Real Madrid, for around US$4 million in net income. At that time, Yugoslav sporting laws stipulated that players could not professionally move abroad until they had reached the age of 28. Petrović was still only 23 when he signed with Real Madrid. In 2014, José Antonio Arízaga, the sports agent who played a key role in Petrović\'s 1988 summer transfer from Cibona to Real, recalled a few details from the transaction: ""I spoke to Mirko Novosel, Dražen\'s head coach at Cibona, and he told me two things. One, every problem in Yugoslavia can be taken care of with the right amount of money, and two, if Dražen leaves, every other player under 28 will be leaving and it\'ll be chaos. So, you can imagine all the individuals I had to bribe and all the places where I had to pay up, in order to circumvent this law"". 1988–89 season Petrović helped Real to win the title of the 1989 edition of the Spanish King\'s Cup, over their Catalan rivals, Barcelona. In the Spanish ACB League\'s Finals, Real Madrid narrowly lost to Barcelona, in the fifth and decisive game of the series. In the Spanish League\'s 1988–89 ACB season, Petrović was the league\'s regular season top scorer. Including the playoffs, he scored a total of 1,327 points, in 47 games played, for a scoring average of 28.2 points per game. Petrović\'s first season in Spain\'s ACB was also his last, but he still holds the ACB\'s single-game Finals records for the most points scored, with 42, and for the most three-pointers made, with 8. In European-wide club competition, Real Madrid competed in the European secondary level FIBA European Cup Winners\' Cup. On 14 March 1989, in the 1988–89 Cup Winners\' Cup Final against the Italian League club Snaidero Caserta, Petrović tied his previous best scoring performance in a European-wide club competition with 62 points. Petrović was pressured to join the NBA, by the Trail Blazers, who had drafted him 60th overall in 1986. Being motivated by the potential new challenges that the NBA presented, Petrović finally decided to try to establish himself in the league. He left Spain rather abruptly, at the end of the season; the Blazers assisted him in the process, by buying out his contract with Real Madrid, for as much as US$1.5 million. Petrović finally joined the Blazers for the 1989–90 season. = The Blazers valued Petrović as a shooter, but were concerned that he might not possess the quickness to play guard or the foot speed to play defense. They brought him onto the team primarily as an outside threat to shoot three-pointers. In the Blazers\' offensive scheme he was to set up behind the line, receive a passed ball and go directly up to release his shot. Petrović was an aggressive, attacking player who was used to creating his shot and shots for his teammates. Taking the ball out of his hands and making him a static shooter was foreign to him. Making matters worse, the Blazers already had a full rotation of guards, with a starting backcourt of Clyde Drexler and Terry Porter, and with veteran Danny Young as a reserve. Consequently, the reigning La Gazzetta dello Sport Euroscar European Player of the Year saw limited playing time. He had difficulty being productive in the limited role the Blazers had for him.', 'My dad had never been in the hospital in 70 years. That\'s the ripple effect."" Williams was the principal owner of the New Jersey Storm of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). The franchise operated for two seasons, 2002 and 2003, before moving to Anaheim, California, and becoming the Anaheim Storm. The team went out of business before the start of the 2006 season. Following his NBA retirement, Williams wrote Loose Balls, a memoir that was published in 2001. Intended to be a humorous perspective on his life in the NBA, later readers noted that the book contained nine separate episodes in which Williams behaved recklessly with guns. In one incident, the former NFL football player Wayne Chrebet was nearly shot. In another, the uncle of Manute Bol was threatened with an unloaded handgun. In 2012, Williams published a second book, an autobiography entitled Humbled ~ Letters From Prison. The book included revelations about his having been abused as a child. A third book, Crashing: A Memoir, was published in December 2018. In 1996, Williams proposed during halftime of a nationally televised basketball game to model Cynthia Bailey. The two later parted.

Paspalj\'s forester father Jovan\'s lumber trade job took him from his home village on the slopes of Kozara in Bosanska Krajina to Pljevlja, finding employment at the Velimir Jakić Lumber Processing Plant (ŠIK Velimir Jakić). Once there he married a local woman, Mileva, and remained. Their first child, son Darko, was born in 1961, five years before Žarko was born in 1966. During the mid-1970s, when young Žarko was ten years old, his father\'s job requirements moved the family to Titograd. Žarko took up basketball and soon established himself in the youth system of KK Budućnost. He considers himself an ethnic Serb from Montenegro, which he believes is ""only natural"". = Paspalj began his career in 1982. At 16 he moved up to Budućnost\'s first team where he was part of a talented generation alongside Zdravko Radulović and Luka Pavićević. At the time, Budućnost was a small, unambitious side that had played its first ever top-tier season two years earlier in 1980–81, essentially serving as talent feeder for bigger Yugoslav League clubs like Partizan, Cibona, Jugoplastika, Crvena zvezda, and Bosna. Not too long after that, Paspalj entered the senior squad. Playing under young head coach Milutin Petrović and alongside seasoned Yugoslav League players such as Nikola Antić and the Ivanović brothers (Duško and Dragan), the talented youngster contributed greatly to Budućnost\'s third place league finish in the 1985–86 season and a playoff semi-final where they lost to eventual champions Zadar. = During the summer of 1986 Budućnost sold 20-year-old Paspalj to Partizan. Eighteen-year-old Vlade Divac, another rising star, also joined the club that summer from Sloga. Together with young Sasha Djordjevic, Željko Obradović and more established players like Milenko Savović and Goran Grbović, they won the national title in a final against Crvena zvezda. Paspalj played well enough to earn a spot on the national team of Yugoslavia that won bronze at the EuroBasket 1987 in Athens, Greece. The following year, in 1988, he played a leading role in the side that made it to the Olympic final against the Soviet Union, and marked himself out as a potential star with some fine performances for Yugoslavia at the 1988 McDonald\'s Open. Also in 1988, Paspalj top-scored for Yugoslavia at the prestigious Acropolis Tournament in Athens, which included 26 points in one half in a tough-fought 104–103 victory against US college side Duke. = In the summer of 1989, Paspalj became one of the first Europeans to move to the NBA, joining the San Antonio Spurs despite going undrafted one year earlier. He came into the league alongside two Soviets (Šarūnas Marčiulionis and Alexander Volkov) and two more fellow Yugoslavs (Dražen Petrović and Vlade Divac) as they were collectively dubbed the ""green card five"" by Sports Illustrated. At the time they were the only five players in the entire NBA who didn\'t come up through the American collegiate system.', 'It was his only appearance for the Nets in their eight regular-season games and he did not play in their four playoff games.

Crawford started doing game broadcasts for NBA League Pass alongside Quentin Richardson in November 2021. He was a regular color analyst for The NBA on TNT starting in the 2022-23 season, also becoming a fixture on the Tuesday studio team before leaving both positions after the conclusion of The NBA on TNT\'s coverage of the 2023–24 season.

In 2015, he resigned from the position. On December 15, 2016, Danilović became the president of the Basketball Federation of Serbia (KSS). Born in Sarajevo to a family of Herzegovinian Serbs (father Milan from the Orašje Zubci village near Trebinje and mother Vuka from the Kukričje village near Bileća), Danilović grew up in the Alipašino polje neighbourhood near the RTV Sarajevo main building. Many of his childhood summers and winters were spent in the villages of his father and mother, and in the town of Trebinje where he had aunts and uncles. A tall and lanky kid, Danilović excelled at a variety of sports, including football, speed skating, and street basketball. Already showing promise at streetball, in 1984, the fourteen-year-old began playing organized basketball in KK Bosna\'s youth setup under youth coach Mladen ""Makso"" Ostojić. The player\'s talent was immediately evident and it didn\'t take long before he started receiving attention from bigger Yugoslav clubs such as KK Partizan whose assistant coach Duško Vujošević was alerted to the youngster\'s talents by the team\'s point guard Željko Obradović who had spotted Danilović during summer 1985 at a Yugoslav intra-republic youth basketball tournament on Mount Zlatibor. Young Danilović played for a select team of players representing SR Bosnia-Herzegovina at the tournament. By late 1985, Vujošević started courting the fifteen-year-old. Getting Danilović and his parents to agree to a move to Belgrade proved to be the easy part; the real challenge was getting his club KK Bosna to sign off on the transfer. Danilović wasn\'t under a professional contract with the Sarajevo club, however, according to Yugoslav Basketball Federation (KSJ) rules, being a youth system prospect, he needed his club\'s permission to complete the move. In Danilović\'s own words: ""Bosna club management weren\'t too keen on me at all while I was there; they had even been planning to loan me out to other Sarajevo-area clubs, which I didn\'t want at all. But then Vujošević started sniffing around, and they suddenly wanted to keep me. Also, Bosna club president Mirza Delibašić and Partizan vice-president Dragan Kićanović were close friends going back to their playing days, so that created additional awkwardness and the whole thing dragged out for a while"". Since Bosna didn\'t want to let him go, by the summer of \'86 Danilović and Partizan decided to act unilaterally to move the player to Belgrade, knowing full well he\'d have to sit out a year before taking part in official competitions. The move marked the beginning of a long friendship and professional association between Danilović and Vujošević, with the twenty-eight-year-old coach initially acting as a mentor to the sixteen-year-old player. By December 1986 Vujošević had moved up in the Partizan club hierarchy, becoming head coach in place of the fired Vladislav Lučić while young Danilović trained by himself and with the first team. Due to the unfortunate administrative situation, Danilović could only practice with Partizan players, which he did vigorously and assiduously, up to 7 or 8 hours per day. He stated in later interviews that it wasn\'t until his arrival at Partizan that he started training seriously. His living arrangements were provided for by the club; they put him up in a room at the JNA Stadium that he shared with youngster teammates Oliver Popović and Popović\'s brother. Furthermore, in accordance with his parents\' wishes, the club ensured he also pursued his full-time secondary education by getting enrolled in the streamlined Petar Drapšin Technical High School. However, unable to make the classes due to frequent, lengthy practices, he soon switched to part-time education at the streamlined touristic high school. Discussing his first days in Belgrade and arrival at a new club, Danilović later said: Certain people at Partizan liked me very much, but there were also those within the club who thought I was a \'neanderthal from Sarajevo\' because I was a very brazen kid and I practiced like an animal. At that moment, for me, Vujošević was both a coach and a father.', 'Thomas was born in Brooklyn, New York. He played collegiately for Providence College.

Rivers won the Coach of the Year award in 2000 after his first year with the Magic. Despite having been picked to finish last in that year\'s standings, Rivers led the Magic close to a playoff berth. During the Magic\'s free agency spending spree in the summer of 2000, Rivers tried to assemble a ""Big Three"" team in the NBA. The Magic were courting free agent Tim Duncan, who came close to signing with the Magic and teaming up with fellow stars Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady. However, Duncan re-signed with the San Antonio Spurs due to Rivers\' strict policy of family members not being allowed to travel on the team\'s plane. The Magic made the postseason in Rivers\'s next three years as head coach, but he was fired in 2003 after a 1–10 start to the season. = After spending a year working as a commentator for the NBA on ABC (calling the 2004 Finals with Al Michaels), he was hired by the Boston Celtics as their head coach in 2004. During his first years with the Celtics, he was criticized by many in the media for his coaching style, most vociferously by Bill Simmons, who in 2006 publicly called for Rivers to be fired in his columns. As a result of the Celtics\' 109–93 victory over the New York Knicks on January 21, 2008, Rivers, as the coach of the team with the best winning percentage in the Eastern Conference, earned the honor to coach the East for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans.

The 2014 NBA playoffs first round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors was marred when TMZ released an audiotape containing racially insensitive remarks made by the then-Clippers owner Donald Sterling. Though there was a possibility of the Clippers boycotting the series, they instead played on, instead holding a silent protest by leaving their shooting jerseys at center court and obscuring the Clippers logo on their warm-up shirts. Rivers himself stated that he would not return to the Clippers if Sterling remained as owner the following season. NBA commissioner Adam Silver responded to the controversy by banning Sterling from the NBA for life and compelling him to sell the team. The team was sold to Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2 billion on August 12, 2014, and Rivers remained with the Clippers.

The referees did not call a foul on the play, and Russell later remarked, ""Whether he pushed off or not, he was making that shot."" He and Jordan were teammates when they played for the Washington Wizards during the 2002–03 NBA season, which was Jordan\'s last. In 2009, Jordan mentioned Russell in his Hall of Fame induction speech, recalling an interaction they had during Jordan\'s first retirement in 1994: ""[A]t this time, I had no thoughts of coming back and playing the game of basketball. Bryon Russell came over to me and said, \'Why did you quit? You know I could guard you.\' ... From this day forward, if I ever see [Russell] in shorts, I\'m coming at him.""

During the 2006 NBA All-Star Weekend, Billups participated in the Three-point Shootout contest. He was eliminated in the first round of the contest after scoring 12 points. Billups called this moment when all four Pistons entered the game at the same time, one of the highlight moments of his career.

During Campbell's tenure with the Pistons, perhaps his most important contribution was his defense against center Shaquille O'Neal in the two playoff series in which the Pistons engaged O'Neal's teams (against the Lakers in the 2004 NBA Finals and against the Miami Heat in the 2005 NBA Eastern Conference Finals); because of his enormous bulk and strength, he presented a unique challenge to O'Neal in the low post and was one of the few NBA players who could pose a serious physical challenge to O'Neal on defense.

Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East. James\'s final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting. In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the NBA Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Golden State Warriors, who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season. To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses. James responded by registering back-to-back 41-point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a chasedown block on Andre Iguodala\'s go-ahead layup attempt, as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city\'s first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals. James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7, and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game, he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection. 2016–2018: End of second stint in Cleveland Following the championship, James again opted out of his contract and re-signed with the Cavaliers, this time on a three-year, $100 million contract, in which the final year was a player option. The 2016–17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers; James later described it as one of the ""strangest"" years of his career. Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, James publicly criticized Cleveland\'s front office for constructing a team that he felt was too ""top heavy"", for which he received countercriticism. The Cavaliers finished the season as the East\'s second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game. In Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Indiana Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Jordan as the league\'s all-time postseason scoring leader. The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to the NBA Finals for the third consecutive time against the Golden State Warriors, who had signed James\'s rival Kevin Durant during the off-season. Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12.0 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games. Prior to the start of the 2017–18 season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by trading Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James. After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December. Their turnaround began with a victory over the Wizards on November 3 where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record. In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort. The next month, James won his third All-Star Game MVP Award, after posting 29 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, and several key plays to help Team LeBron win over Team Curry. Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double digits. James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, and 4.2 turnovers per game. In the playoffs, James guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the Golden State Warriors. Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors, after which a new nickname, ""LeBronto"" was popularized. In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland lost 124–114 in overtime. Following the loss, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series. The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James averaging 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game for the Finals. = 2018–2019: Injury and playoff miss On June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent. Two days later, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers on a four-year, $153.5 million contract; the deal was officially completed on July 9. In an interview with Sports Illustrated, James\'s agent Rich Paul explained: ""In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do."" Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination. The Lakers expected James to immediately transform them into a championship contender after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the Finals since 2010. Following his signing, the team rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. To begin the 2018–19 season, the Lakers struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games. In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James\'s strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers. Four days later, James scored a season-high 51 points in a victory over the Heat. After blowing out the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day, Los Angeles improved their record to 20–14, but James suffered a groin injury, the first major injury of his career. James missed a then career-high 17 consecutive games, and the Lakers fell out of playoff contention without him, marking the first time that James missed the playoffs since 2005. In March, the Lakers announced that James would begin a minutes restriction, and he was later officially ruled out for the rest of the season. James\'s final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game. Despite his inconsistent campaign, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in twelve years that he did not make the All-NBA First Team. 2019–2020: Fourth NBA championship During the offseason, the Lakers hired Frank Vogel as their new head coach, and traded the majority of their young core to the Pelicans for superstar big man Anthony Davis. James immediately embraced the team\'s much-improved roster by transforming his playing style, moving to full-time point guard, and competing with a more consistent defensive effort. Behind James\'s leadership, the Lakers opened the 2019–20 season with a 17–2 record, matching the best start in franchise history. On January 25, James scored his 33,644th career point, passing Kobe Bryant for third on the all-time regular season scoring list. The following day, Bryant died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California. James delivered an improvised eulogy in honor of Bryant at Staples Center, before a January 31 game against the Portland Trail Blazers. In early March, before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, James led the Lakers to a victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in a matchup of conference leaders, followed by a streak-breaking victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. Regular season play resumed in July and concluded in August within the confined NBA Bubble, where James ended the regular season as the league leader in assists for the first time in his career, averaging 10.2 assists per game. He earned a record 16th All-NBA Team selection as part of the First Team, extending his record First Team selections to 13. The Lakers entered the playoffs as the top seed in the West and advanced to the NBA Finals convincingly, with only three total losses along the way. In Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals against the Denver Nuggets, James helped clinch the conference championship by scoring a game-high 38 points, including 16 in the fourth quarter. In the Finals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with his former team, the Miami Heat, and quickly took control of the series with a 2–0 lead. In Game 5, James had his best statistical performance of the Finals with 40 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists in a memorable duel with Miami\'s Jimmy Butler, but Los Angeles was ultimately defeated in a three-point game. The Lakers eliminated the Heat in Game 6, which earned James, who averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game during the series, his fourth NBA championship and fourth Finals MVP award. At 35 years and 287 days old, James became the second-oldest player in league history to win the award, and the only player in NBA history to win the award with three different franchises. James and teammate Danny Green also became the third and fourth players in NBA history to win at least one championship with three different teams each. 2020–2021: Back-to-back chase Following the championship, James would sign a two-year, $85.7 million extension that would keep him with the Lakers through the 2022–23 season. The 2020–2021 season, reduced to 72 games for each team and starting on December 22, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, began after the shortest offseason in NBA history with a 116–109 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. On December 31, James became the first player in NBA history to score 10 points or more in 1,000 consecutive games in a 121–107 victory over the San Antonio Spurs. On February 18, 2021, James became the third player in NBA history with 35,000 career points, joining Hall of Famers Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone; aged 36 years and 50 days, he was the youngest player to reach the milestone. On March 20, James sprained his ankle against the Atlanta Hawks, but was able to hit a three-point shot afterwards to keep his 10-points streak alive before exiting the game.']",David Rivers and the Los Angeles Lakers faced the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals.,NBA Finals in 1988,,0.9417504878871575,0.7222222221981481,,0.5923107764790168,0.8692107851748049

The shows were to be his first major concerts since the HIStory World Tour in 1997. Jackson suggested he would retire after the shows. The initial plan was for ten concerts in London, followed by shows in Paris, New York City and Mumbai. Randy Phillips, the president and chief executive of AEG Live, predicted the first ten dates would earn Jackson £50 million. The London residency was increased to fifty dates after record-breaking ticket sales; more than one million were sold in less than two hours. The concerts were to run from July 13, 2009, to March 6, 2010. Jackson moved to Los Angeles, where he rehearsed in the weeks leading up to the tour under the direction of the choreographer Kenny Ortega, whom he had worked with during his previous tours.

He then played one year for the Houston Rockets which saw him make an appearance in the 1986 NBA Finals and then two years for the Chicago Bulls, before he left the NBA for Europe in 1988.

The proceeds went to the Nelson Mandela Children\'s Fund, the Red Cross and UNESCO. In 1999, Jackson was presented with the ""Outstanding Humanitarian Award"" at Bollywood Movie Awards in New York City where he noted Mahatma Gandhi to have been an inspiration for him. From August 1999 to 2000, he lived in New York City at 4 East 74th Street. At the turn of the century, Jackson was awarded with the Artist of the 1980s Decade Award at the 27th American Music Awards, and the Best-Selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium Award at the 12nd World Music Awards. In 2000, Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer. In September 2001, two concerts were held at Madison Square Garden to mark Jackson\'s 30th year as a solo artist. Jackson performed with his brothers for the first time since 1984. The show also featured Mýa, Usher, Whitney Houston, Destiny\'s Child, Monica, Liza Minnelli and Slash. The first show was marred by technical lapses, and the crowd booed a speech by Marlon Brando. 45 million people watched the television broadcast of the shows in November according to Nielsen Media Research. After the September 11 attacks (in which Jackson narrowly avoided death by oversleeping and missing a scheduled meeting at the World Trade Center), Jackson helped organize the United We Stand: What More Can I Give benefit concert at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., on October 21, 2001. Jackson performed ""What More Can I Give"" as the finale. The release of Invincible was preceded by a dispute between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had expected the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him in the early 2000s, after which he would be able to promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits, but clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract. Invincible was released on October 30, 2001. It was Jackson\'s first full-length album in six years, and the last album of original material he released in his lifetime. It debuted at number one in 13 countries, and went on to sell eight million copies worldwide, receiving double-platinum certification in the US. On January 9, 2002, Jackson won his 22nd American Music Award for Artist of the Century. Later that year, an anonymous surrogate mother gave birth to his third child, Prince Michael Jackson II (nicknamed ""Blanket""), who had been conceived by artificial insemination. On November 20, Jackson briefly held Blanket over the railing of his Berlin hotel room, four stories above ground level, prompting widespread criticism in the media. Jackson apologized for the incident, calling it ""a terrible mistake"". On January 22, promoter Marcel Avram filed a breach of contract complaint against Jackson for failing to perform two planned 1999 concerts. In March, a Santa Maria jury ordered Jackson to pay Avram $5.3 million (equivalent to $9.3 million in 2024). On December 18, 2003, Jackson\'s attorneys dropped all appeals on the verdict and settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount. On April 24, 2002, Jackson performed at Apollo Theater. The concert was a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and former President Bill Clinton. The money collected would be used to encourage citizens to vote. It raised $2.5 million (equivalent to $3.8 million in 2024). The concert was called Michael Jackson: Live at the Apollo and was one of Jackson\'s final on-stage performances. In July 2002, at Al Sharpton\'s National Action Network in Harlem, Jackson called the Sony Music chairman Tommy Mottola ""a racist, and very, very, very devilish"", and accused him of exploiting black artists for his own gain. The accusation prompted Sharpton to form a coalition investigating whether Mottola exploited black artists. Jackson charged that Mottola had called his colleague Irv Gotti a ""fat nigger"". Sony issued a statement calling the accusations ""ludicrous, spiteful, and hurtful"" and said Mottola had championed Jackson\'s career for years. Sony refused to renew Jackson\'s contract and said that a $25 million (equivalent to $43.7 million in 2024) promotional campaign had failed because Jackson refused to tour in the US for Invincible. = Beginning in May 2002, a documentary film crew led by Martin Bashir followed Jackson for several months.', 'ISBN 978-1-989555-83-5.', ""Sharone Addaryl Wright (born January 30, 1973) is an American former professional basketball player.

There’s no way I lose"". On July 9, Jackson\'s investigator, Anthony Pellicano, met Jordan, who denied any abuse or inappropriate touching by Jackson. Evan Chandler\'s lawyer would later call Beverly Hills psychiatrist Dr. Mathis Abrams and present him with a hypothetical situation. In reply and without having met either Jordan Chandler or his parents, Abrams sent Rothman a two-page letter in which he states that ""reasonable suspicion would exist that sexual abuse may have occurred"" after receiving the letter from Dr Abrams Evan Chandler allegedly received a confession from his son Jordan. Evan demands $20 million from Jackson on August 4, 1993, without going to law enforcement regarding the reports of the abuse that was claimed to have taken place, but Jackson refused and sued Chandler for extortion. Later a meeting at the Westwood Marquis Hotel, Evan and his son Jordan met Michael Jackson and Anthony Pellicano without their lawyer Barry Rothman, Evan greeted Jackson with a hug before pulling out a letter from Dr. Mathis Abrams and reading its allegations of child molestation aloud, As Evan cited the molestation references, Jordan lowered his head and then looked at Jackson with evident surprise, casting doubt on the claims as he had reportedly already reported his confession weeks prior. The encounter concluded with Evan pointing at Jackson and declaring, ""I\'m going to ruin you,"" revealing a clear intent to threaten rather than seek justice—a stark contrast to the embrace that opened the meeting. From August 9–13, 1993 Evan Chandler and his legal team made various counteroffers to secure a settlement from Jackson, escalating their financial demands after his refusal to pay the initial $20 million, with Evan later filing a civil suit in September demanding $30 million for alleged damages which were all denied by Jackson, prompting Chandler to go public with the claims of child molestation. Jackson\'s older sister La Toya accused him of being a pedophile; she later retracted this, saying she had been forced into it by her abusive husband. Prosecutors raided Neverland Ranch and other places of residency while Jackson was on tour in August, but no leads were found as the investigators ruled that there was no medical evidence or physical evidence. Additionally hundreds of children were investigated but all of them stated no abuse or improper behavior had taken place. Attention was later brought to two legal art books depicting featuring young boys playing, running, and swimming in various states of undress, however Jackson denied knowing of the books\' content and claimed if they were there, someone had to have sent them to him and he did not open them. No child pornography or other incriminating evidence was found. In December 1993, Prosecutor Tom Sneddon filed a strip search on Jackson based on the drawing obtained by Jordan Chandler which had been sent to the authorities, however the drawing did not match and prosecutors sought out Jackson\'s doctors and family inquiring about the possibility the singer had altered his genitals as to explain the mismatch. In November 1993, Jackson requested that the civil trial be postponed until after the criminal hearing was completed due to a violation of his civil rights, under the circumstances of having to defend himself under double jeopardy. This motion was denied and in January 1994 the civil lawsuit was settled for $15,331,250 with separate payments of 1.5 million for Evan and June Chandler coming out to a total of 18.3 million allocated to the Chandler family, lower than the initial demand of 20-30 million requested by Evan Chandler. The document shows that the Chandlers dropped the child molestation allegations from their complaint with Jackson\'s settlement being filed over claims of negligence. It was later revealed that this settlement did not prevent the Chandlers from testifying in the criminal case The police never pressed criminal charges. The prosecution continued to investigate Jackson from January to June 1994 with Jordan Chandler continuing to co-operate with investigators, by July 1994 multiple grand juries had been called however jurors remarked that no damaging evidence was heard against Jackson. ""The [Santa Barbara] grand jury in Michael Jackson\'s case was dismissed and one juror said he heard no evidence against [Jackson]... Another juror told CNN that he heard no evidence against him [Jackson] during the hearing."" On September 21, 1994, after 400 witnesses had been investigated with another 30 called in front of the grand juries, the investigation was closed. A few potential leads had been found but all of them turned out to be false. Jackson had been taking painkillers for his reconstructive scalp surgeries, administered due to the Pepsi commercial accident in 1984, and became dependent on them to cope with the stress of the sexual abuse allegations. On November 12, 1993, Jackson canceled the remainder of the Dangerous World Tour due to health problems, stress from the allegations and painkiller addiction. He thanked his close friend Elizabeth Taylor for support, encouragement and counsel. The end of the tour concluded his sponsorship deal with Pepsi. In late 1993, Jackson proposed to Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of Elvis Presley, over the phone. They were married in La Vega, Dominican Republic, in May 1994 by civil judge Hugo Francisco Álvarez Pérez. The tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a publicity stunt to deflect away from Jackson\'s sexual abuse allegations and jump-start Presley\'s career as a singer. Their marriage ended little more than a year later, and they separated in December 1995. Presley cited ""irreconcilable differences"" when filing for divorce the next month and only sought to reclaim her maiden name as her settlement. After the divorce, Judge Pérez said, ""They lasted longer than I thought they would. I gave them a year. They lasted a year and a half."" Presley later said she and Jackson had attempted to reconcile intermittently for four years following their divorce, and that she had traveled the world to be with him. Jackson composed music for the Sega Genesis video game Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994), but left the project around the time the sexual abuse allegations surfaced and went uncredited. Jackson\'s involvement was the subject of fan speculation for decades until Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka confirmed it in 2022. Sega Technical Institute director Roger Hector and Sonic co-creator Naoto Ohshima said that Jackson was terminated and his music reworked following the allegations. However, Jackson\'s musical director Brad Buxer and other members of Jackson\'s team said he went uncredited because he was unhappy with how the Genesis replicated his music. The game\'s credits theme served as the basis for Jackson\'s 1996 song ""Stranger in Moscow"". = In June 1995, Jackson released the double album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. The first disc, HIStory Begins, is a greatest hits album (reissued in 2001 as Greatest Hits: HIStory, Volume I). The second disc, HIStory Continues, contains 13 original songs and two cover versions. The album debuted at number one on the charts and has been certified for eight million shipments in the US. It is the bestselling multi-disc album of all time, with 20 million copies (40 million units) sold worldwide. HIStory received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. The New York Times reviewed it as ""the testimony of a musician whose self-pity now equals his talent"". The first single from HIStory was ""Scream/Childhood"". ""Scream"", a duet with Jackson\'s youngest sister Janet, protests the media\'s treatment of Jackson during the 1993 child abuse allegations against him. The single reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100, and received a Grammy nomination for ""Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals"".']","In 2007, Doug Christie sold 1,800 copies of The Christie’s Un-Cut, a self-made comedy featuring satirical sketches of him and his wife.",2007,0.5,0.9185817577580804,0.9999999999,,0.6971616283390126,0.7886465133560506

More important for his work overall may have been his position as an expatriate, and in other ways an outsider, living in Europe. While he came from middle-class and provincial beginnings (seen from the perspective of European polite society), he worked very hard to gain access to all levels of society, and the settings of his fiction range from working-class to aristocratic, and often describe the efforts of middle-class Americans to make their way in European capitals. He confessed he got some of his best story ideas from gossip at the dinner table or at country house weekends. He worked for a living, however, and lacked the experiences of select schools, university, and army service, the common bonds of masculine society. He was furthermore a man whose tastes and interests were, according to the prevailing standards of Victorian era Anglo-American culture, rather feminine, and who was shadowed by the cloud of prejudice that then and later accompanied suspicions of his homosexuality. Edmund Wilson compared James\'s objectivity to Shakespeare\'s: One would be in a position to appreciate James better if one compared him with the dramatists of the seventeenth century—Racine and Molière, whom he resembles in form as well as in point of view, and even Shakespeare, when allowances are made for the most extreme differences in subject and form.

He finished the season with averages of 16.6 points, 7.7 assists and 3.9 rebounds across his 31 games."", ""He played for the Lakers for 10 consecutive seasons (1983–1993). During that time he was on three NBA championship teams (1985, 1987, 1988). As a rookie, Scott was a member of the 1984 all-rookie team, averaging 10.6 PPG in 22 MPG. He led the NBA in three-point field goal percentage (.433) in 1984–85. In 1987–88, Scott enjoyed his best season, leading the NBA champion Lakers in scoring, averaging a career-best 21.7 ppg, and in steals (1.91 spg). He was the Lakers' starting shooting guard from 1984 until 1993. Scott was released by the Lakers after the 1992–93 season and signed a free-agent contract with the Pacers. In Game 1 of the Pacers' first-round playoff matchup against the Orlando Magic, Scott hit the game-winning three-point shot with 2.4 seconds left. The Pacers would go on to sweep the Magic and eventually advance to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in franchise history. Scott was left unprotected by the Pacers in the 1995 NBA expansion draft and was selected by the Vancouver Grizzlies, where he played one season. In 1996–97, the last year of Scott's playing career in the NBA, he went back to the Lakers and proved to be a valuable mentor for a team featuring Shaquille O'Neal, Eddie Jones, Nick Van Exel and 18-year-old rookie Kobe Bryant (Scott would be Bryant's coach on the Lakers towards the end of the latter's career). The Lakers made it to the playoffs in the 1996-97 season with a 56 - 26 record and reached the semi-finals against the Utah Jazz. Game 4 of this series was Scott's last game of his NBA career. In that game, Scott played for 15 and half minutes and recorded 4 points and 5 assists. The Lakers unfortunately lost the game 95 - 110 to drop to 3 - 1 in the series. Scott would sit out for Game 5 as the Lakers lost 93 - 98 and were eliminated from the playoffs. = In the summer of 1997, Scott signed with the Greek Basket League team Panathinaikos for the 1997–98 season. That season, he played with Panathinaikos in both the FIBA Saporta Cup (known then as the FIBA EuroCup), Europe's second-tier level competition after the top-tier EuroLeague, and the Greek Basket League. In the Saporta Cup's 1997–98 season, he averaged 13.4 points, 2.4 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 1.1 steals, in 25.6 minutes per game, in 17 games played. Scott helped to lead his team to the Greek Basket League championship with his scoring in many crucial games. In the Greek Basket League's 1997–98 season, he averaged 17.6 points, 2.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists, and 1.3 steals per game, in 33.7 minutes per game, in 34 games played. After one season with the Greek Basket League champions, Scott retired from playing professional basketball, and began his coaching career. = Scott began his NBA coaching career in 1998 as an assistant with the Sacramento Kings under Rick Adelman. He served as an advance scout that looked at game plans on offense alongside work in the perimeter. = On June 27, 2000, Scott was hired to coach the New Jersey Nets after being offered the job the previous day by general manager Rod Thorn. He was hired to replace Don Casey, who had been fired on April 26 after coaching the team since March 1999. Scott was considered for the Indiana Pacers job prior to reaching with Thorn, who himself had been hired recently to try and turn over a team that had missed the playoffs in five of the past six seasons while having had twelve head coaches in 23 seasons as an NBA franchise; the day that Scott was hired was right before the 2000 NBA draft, for which the Nets had the first overall pick. His team performed poorly in his first year, winning just 26 games with new draft pick Kenyon Martin."", 'In his freshman season, Jerry boasted a 54.5 field goal and 81.6 free throw percentage.', 'He stated, ""I can\'t explain what tonight meant. I did it for me. I\'ve won and lost a lot of games, but the last memory I had was being carried off the court. I couldn\'t get over the mental block of being carried off the court. It was important psychologically to walk off the court on my own."" After the basket, Barkley immediately retired and concluded his sixteen-year Hall of Fame career. Barkley was invited by Bob Knight to try out for United States men\'s basketball team for the 1984 Summer Olympics. He made it all the way to final cuts, but was not selected for the team, despite outplaying almost all of the front-court players there. According to Knight, Barkley was cut because of poor defense. Barkley competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games and won two gold medals as a member of the United States men\'s basketball team. International rules that previously prevented NBA players from playing in the Olympics were changed in 1992, allowing Barkley and fellow NBA players to compete in the Olympics for the first time. The team was nicknamed the ""Dream Team"" and went 6–0 in the Olympic qualifying tournament and 8–0 against Olympic opponents. The team averaged an Olympic record 117.3 points a game and won games by an average of 43.8 points, only surpassed by the 1956 U.S. Olympic team. Barkley led the team with 18.0 points on 71.1% field goal shooting and set a then-Olympic single-game scoring record with 30 points in a 127–83 victory over Brazil. He also set a U.S. Men\'s Olympic record for highest three-point field goal percentage with 87.5% and added 4.1 rebounds and 2.6 steals per game. During the game versus Angola, Barkley elbowed Herlander Coimbra in the chest and was unapologetic after the game, claiming he was hit first. Barkley was called for an intentional foul on the play. Coimbra\'s resulting free throw was the only point scored by Angola during a 46–1 run by the U.S. At the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games, Barkley led the team in scoring, rebounds, and field goal percentage. He averaged 12.4 points on 81.6% field goal shooting, setting a U.S. Men\'s Olympic record. In addition, he also contributed 6.6 rebounds per game. Under Barkley\'s leadership, the team once again compiled a perfect 8–0 record and captured gold medal. Barkley played the power forward position, but occasionally played small forward and center. He was known for his unusual build as a basketball player, stockier than most small forwards, yet shorter than most power forwards he faced. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his unusual combination of strength and agility. Barkley was a prolific scorer who averaged 22.1 points per game during the regular season for his career and 23.0 points per game in the playoffs for his career. Barkley was an incredibly efficient offensive force, leading the NBA in 2-point field goal percentage every season from the 1986–87 season to the 1990–91 season. He led the league in effective field goal percentage in both the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons as well, and also led the league in offensive rating in both the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons. He was one of the NBA\'s most versatile players and accurate scorers capable of scoring from anywhere on the court and established himself as one of the NBA\'s premier clutch players. During his NBA career, Barkley was a constant mismatch because he possessed a very uncommon combination of skills and could play in a variety of positions. He would use all facets of his game in a single play; as a scorer, he had the ability to score from the perimeter and the post, using an array of spin moves and fadeaways, or finishing a fast break with a powerful dunk. He was one of the most efficient scorers of all time, scoring at 54.13% total field goal percentage for his season career and 51.34% total field goal shooting for his playoff career (including a career-high season average of 60% during the 1989–90 NBA season). Barkley is the shortest player in NBA history to lead the league in rebounding when he averaged a career-high 14.6 rebounds per game during the 1986–87 season. His tenacious and aggressive form of play built into an undersized frame that fluctuated between 284 pounds (129 kg) and 252 pounds (114 kg) helped cement his legacy as one of the greatest rebounders in NBA history, averaging 11.7 rebounds per game in the regular season for his career and 12.9 rebounds per game in his playoff career and totaling 12,546 rebounds for his season career. Barkley topped the NBA in offensive rebounding for three straight years and was most famous among very few power forwards who could control a defensive rebound, dribble the length of the court and finish at the rim with a powerful dunk. Barkley also possessed considerable defensive talents led by an aggressive demeanor, foot speed and his capacity to read the floor to anticipate for steals, a reason why he established his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power forward position and leader of the highest all-time steal per game average for the power forward position. Despite being undersized for both the small forward and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in blocked shots. His speed and leaping ability made him one of the few power forwards capable of running down court to block a faster player with a chase-down block. In a SLAM magazine issue ranking NBA greats, Barkley was ranked among the top 20 players of All-Time. In the magazine, NBA Hall-of-Famer Bill Walton commented on Barkley\'s ability. Walton stated, ""Barkley is like Magic [Johnson] and Larry [Bird] in that they don\'t really play a position. He plays everything; he plays basketball.', 'He also recorded a career high field goal attempts and made field goals.', ""Clint N'Dumba Capela (born May 18, 1994) is a Swiss professional basketball player for the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Known for his rebounding and shot-blocking abilities, he was selected with the 25th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft by the Houston Rockets. He is the highest-earning team athlete in Switzerland's history. Capela began his professional career in 2012 with Élan Chalon of the LNB Pro A, where he played for two seasons and was honored as both the Pro A Best Young Player and Most Improved Player before declaring for the NBA draft in 2014. His breakout season came in 2016–17 with the Rockets, as he saw a substantial increase in his role as a center and a key defensive player. He achieved the league's highest field goal percentage during the 2017–18 season, his 62.1% career field goal accuracy is the fourth highest in NBA history, and has remained among the top players in rebounds and blocks, leading the NBA in rebounding during the 2021–22 season as a member of the Atlanta Hawks.

In the 2007–08 season, Scott had his first winning season as the Hornets head coach. They had a winning percentage of .683 with a record of 56–26. They became Southwest Division champions and finished 2nd overall in the Western Conference. He was named the head coach of the 2008 Western Conference All-Star team, and a few months after, he was awarded the 2007–08 NBA Coach of the Year Award. Due to his success, the Hornets awarded Scott with a two-year extension. The Hornets had a 30–11 home record and a 26–15 road record and clinched the second seed in the Western Conference Playoffs. The Hornets won their first-round series against the Dallas Mavericks, posting a 4–1 record for the series. They would go on to face the defending champion San Antonio Spurs in the conference semifinals. An unusual trend of home court blowouts would mark the series until the deciding game 7 when the veteran Spurs would pull out a 91–82 win on the Hornets rowdy home court. The win marked the 100th playoff victory for Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. In the 2008–09 season, the Hornets finished 49–33 and entered the playoffs as a seventh seed. They faced the Denver Nuggets in the first round, losing after five brutal games, including a 58-point loss in game 4, which tied the worst margin of defeat in NBA postseason history. Scott was relieved from his head coaching duties for the Hornets on November 12, 2009, following a 3–6 start. He was mentioned as a candidate for several NBA coaching jobs, including the Los Angeles Clippers, but nothing came to fruition. Following his dismissal, he briefly served as a studio analyst for the NBA on ESPN. = On July 1, 2010, Scott was named head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, a few days before the team lost star LeBron James to the Miami Heat. During Scott's first season at the helm of the Cavaliers, he watched his team endure a 26-game losing streak, which was then the longest such streak in NBA history. Scott was reunited with Baron Davis (whom he coached with the Hornets) when a mid-season trade brought Davis to Cleveland, and helped the Cavaliers close the season with several victories, including a 102–90 upset victory over LeBron James and the Miami Heat, which ensured that Cleveland did not have the worst record in the league at the season's end. Cleveland used their first overall pick to draft Kyrie Irving, who became the second point guard Scott coached to the Rookie of the Year award. His second season in Cleveland saw them show some improvement in a shortened 66-game schedule. On April 18, 2013, Scott was fired by Cleveland Cavaliers management. Though the Cavaliers ranked in the bottom five of the league in defensive efficiency in each of his three seasons, analysts were surprised at the firing given the team's young and oft-injured rosters. Irving and other Cavaliers players expressed their disappointment with the firing. = Scott spent the 2013–14 season as a Lakers television analyst on Time Warner Cable SportsNet. After the season, he was the frontrunner to become the new Lakers head coach. He interviewed three times for the position, which had become vacant after Mike D'Antoni's resignation. On July 28, 2014, he signed a multi-year contract to coach the Lakers. With the team rebuilding in 2014–15, Scott finished his first season as coach of the Lakers with a 21–61 record. In the 2015 NBA draft, the Lakers selected Ohio State point guard D'Angelo Russell with the second overall pick. The Lakers finished a franchise-worst 17–65 in 2015–16, Kobe Bryant's final season before retiring. On April 24, 2016, the Lakers did not exercise their option on Scott's contract for the following season, deciding to pursue a new coach. His 38–126 (.232) record with the team was the worst of any of the 16 coaches who had led the franchise for at least two seasons. = Regular season Playoffs Scott's non-profit organization, The Byron Scott Children's Fund, has raised more than $15 million over the past decade, with the proceeds going to various children's charities.

He was the third Trail Blazer to win the award, the first two being Geoff Petrie and Sidney Wicks. 2007–08 season: First All-Star selection Roy started in the first 48 games of the 2007–08 season, averaging 19.1 points, 5.8 assists and 4.6 rebounds. He also led the Blazers to a 13-game winning streak in the month of December. Roy was selected as a reserve for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game. He scored 18 points in that game, and also had 9 rebounds. He injured his right ankle in the final game before the All-Star Weekend. Although he earned accolades for his play over the weekend, the injury impacted his play in the following weeks. He played in the Rookie Challenge for the second time, this time as a ""sophomore""; teammate LaMarcus Aldridge was also on the sophomore squad. Roy played about 29 minutes in the All-Star game, the most of any Western Conference player. He also tied Chris Paul and Amar\'e Stoudemire for the most points with 18. 2008–09 season: First All-NBA selection In the 2008 preseason, Roy underwent a 20-minute medical procedure in Vancouver, Washington, during which team physician Don Roberts removed a piece of cartilage that was causing irritation in Roy\'s left knee. Roy missed several weeks of action because of the rehabilitation, but was ready on the opening day of the season against the Los Angeles Lakers. On November 6, against the Houston Rockets, Roy hit a game-winning 30-foot jumper in overtime with eight tenths of a second left. On December 18, Roy scored a career-high 52 points against the Phoenix Suns. He made 14 of 27 shots from the field, 19 of 21 from the free-throw line, and 5 of 7 from the three-point line. He also added six assists, five rebounds and a blocked shot, all without a turnover. On January 24, Roy tied a Blazers franchise record with 10 steals against the Washington Wizards. On February 8 with the Blazers trailing by 1 against the Knicks, Roy made a layup at the buzzer to win it 109–108. As of February 16, 2009, Roy has had 24 shots which tied or won the games with 35 seconds or less. Roy was again selected as a reserve in the 2009 NBA All-Star Game, where he scored 14 points in 7-for-8 shooting, grabbed 5 boards, and dished out 5 assists in a game-high 31 minutes of action. On April 13, Roy was named Western Conference Player of the Week for his fourth time. At the time, Clyde Drexler was the only other Portland Trail Blazers to have won the award four times. Roy finished 9th in MVP voting for the 2008–09 season, garnering one 4th-place vote and four 5th-place votes for a total of 7 points. Roy was named to the All-NBA Second Team on May 13, and was the first Blazer to make an All-NBA team since the 1991–92 season. 2009–10 season: Second All-NBA selection On August 5, 2009, it was confirmed that Roy had agreed to a four-year maximum-salary contract with a fifth-year player option, keeping him a Trail Blazer until at least the 2013–14 season. Roy was selected to compete in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game, marking his third selection as an NBA All-Star. However, Roy was sidelined because of a right hamstring injury he sustained on January 13 against the Milwaukee Bucks, and re-aggravated on January 20 against the Philadelphia 76ers. On April 11, 2010, Roy injured his right knee. Magnetic resonance imaging that night confirmed a right knee bone contusion (bone bruise) and on April 12, further examination of the MRI showed a slight meniscus tear. Roy underwent surgery on April 16 and was expected to miss at least the first round of the 2010 NBA playoffs, but returned for Game 4 after eight days of recovery time to lead the Blazers to a win. Roy was named to the All-NBA Third Team on May 6, and this was his second season in a row to be named to an All-NBA Team. Shortly before the next season began, conference rival Kobe Bryant called Roy the hardest player to guard in the Western Conference, claiming he had ""no weaknesses in his game."" Roy was the cover athlete for NBA 10: The Inside. 2010–11 season: Final season in Portland Roy started the first month of the season scoring at his normal rate, but by December it started showing that his knees, which have bothered him since college and were injured in April, were ailing due to lack of cartilage. He missed nine games before the Trail Blazers announced that he would be out indefinitely. On January 17, 2011, Roy underwent arthroscopic surgery on both of his knees. He returned to the lineup on February 25, scoring 18 points off the bench, including a clutch three-pointer to force overtime, and helping the Blazers defeat the Denver Nuggets 107–106. The Blazers then faced the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the 2011 NBA playoffs. Roy shot 1-for-8 the first 2 games, including a Game 2 where he saw only 8 minutes of playing time and went scoreless. The Blazers lost both games and trailed 2-0 in the series. He expressed his frustration about being the last substitution during the first 2 quarters, and playing for 8 minutes after getting 26 minutes in Game 1. Both the Blazers and Mavericks started Game 4 with a quiet first half, with Dallas leading slightly. The Blazers then missed their first 15 shots after halftime as the Mavs\' lead grew as big as 67–44. Roy then made a three-pointer near the end of the third to cut the lead to 67–49. In the fourth quarter, Roy scored 18 points after going 1-for-3 the previous 3 quarters, including a clutch 4-point play to tie the game and a bank shot from the middle of the paint with 49 seconds left to give his team the lead for good, finishing with 24 points to lead the Blazers to an improbable 84–82 win to tie the series. Just before NBA training camp opened following the resolution of the 2011 NBA lockout, Roy announced that his knees had degenerated so much—he lacked cartilage between the bones of both knees—that he was retiring from basketball. Following his announcement of retirement, the Portland Trail Blazers used their amnesty clause on Roy for salary cap flexibility. = In June 2012, Roy announced that he was planning to make a comeback to the NBA. He said he had recovered enough to play after having the platelet-rich plasma procedure that Kobe Bryant also had to keep his knees healthy. He could not play for Portland under the current NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement because of Portland\'s amnesty of him in 2011. Roy entered the free agent market on July 1, 2012. Roy reportedly had expressed interest in signing with the Dallas Mavericks, Golden State Warriors, Minnesota Timberwolves, Indiana Pacers, or Chicago Bulls. On July 31, 2012, Roy signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves. The deal put Roy with All-Star forward Kevin Love and point guard Ricky Rubio. He decided to wear No.', 'He would knock down the trophies of his sister and challenge his sister Krystal to games. His sister later said, ""Most people learn basketball early on with a one-on-one kind of mentality... Tim at an early age didn\'t have that. He always wanted to make the team better and do whatever it takes to help the team out. He is such a true point guard."" In his childhood, he was considered too small for contact sports but was noted for his quickness, which helped him thrive as a guard on the court.

According to TexasHoops.com, he was the best recruit in the state, and the Houston Chronicle labeled him the Boys Basketball Player of the Year. Frazier played with the Houston Elite Amateur Athletic Union team, which had produced players such as Anthony Thompson, Eddren McCain and Chris Roberts, all of whom attended Bradley University. He graduated high school cum laude. On October 23, 2008, Frazier verbally committed to the Penn State Nittany Lions basketball team. He said to Scout.com, ""I decided to be a Nittany Lion because I felt it was a great fit for me. Penn State has great academics as well as a great basketball team and that\'s what I was looking for.""

In the season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers on October 31, Lillard recorded 23 points and 11 assists to join Oscar Robertson and Allen Iverson as the only players in NBA history with at least 20 points and 10 assists in their NBA debut. In addition, his 11 assists were the most by an NBA rookie in his first game since Jason Kidd (11) in 1994, and the most ever by a Trail Blazer in his NBA debut. Lillard made a career-high 15 field goals and a Trail Blazer rookie-record seven 3-pointers on January 11 against the Golden State Warriors, where he finished with 37 points, six rebounds, and four assists. He became the first Trail Blazer to win an event at the NBA All-Star Weekend, winning the Skills Challenge. He also participated in the Rising Stars Challenge during All-Star weekend and finished with 18 points, three rebounds and five assists in a game-high 28 minutes. Lillard became the first NBA rookie to record 35 points, nine assists and zero turnovers in a game since turnovers became a stat in 1978–79 against the San Antonio Spurs on March 8. On April 10 against the Lakers, Lillard scored a season-high 38 points. He earned Western Conference Rookie of the Month honors for every month, becoming one of just eight players to sweep NBA Rookie of the Month honors since the inaugural award in 1981–82. He finished fifth in the NBA in 3-pointers made, 12th in points per game, tied for 16th in assists per game and tied for 23rd in free throw percentage. He was one of 10 NBA players to score 1,500 points, and he led all rookies in scoring (19.0 ppg), assists (6.5 apg), field goals (553) and free throws (271). With averages of 19.0 points, 3.1 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 0.90 steals, and 38.6 minutes in 82 games (all starting), Lillard not only claimed the NBA Rookie of the Year Award but joined Blake Griffin (2011), David Robinson (1990), and Ralph Sampson (1984) as the only unanimous winners. He also joined Oscar Robertson and Allen Iverson as the only rookies in NBA history to tally in excess of 1,500 points and 500 assists for a season. Lillard became the fourth Trail Blazer in franchise history to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors and one of two to ever finish a season with at least 1,500 points and 500 assists (the other being Clyde Drexler in 1986–87 and 1991–92). Among other distinctions, he broke the all-time NBA rookie record for 3-pointers in a season (185), surpassing Stephen Curry's 166 three-pointers in 2009–10; became the Portland franchise leader for most 3-point field goals in a season, breaking Damon Stoudamire's record of 181 in 2004–05; and became the first rookie to lead the NBA in total minutes played (3,167) since Elvin Hayes in 1968–69. 2013–14 season: First All-Star and All-NBA selection In the season opener on October 30, Lillard scored 32 points against the Phoenix Suns. He had a second 32-point effort on December 7 against the Dallas Mavericks."", 'He was known for his tenacious rebounding and blue-collar defense. During his career, he played with the Sacramento Kings (where he made First Team All-Rookie in the 1994–95 season), Portland Trail Blazers, Miami Heat, Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix Suns. Grant grew up in the small, rural community of Georgetown, Ohio, near the Ohio River about 40 miles southeast of Cincinnati. During summers, he spent most of his time working at area farms, cutting, housing, and stripping tobacco, digging potatoes and baling hay. He played basketball at Georgetown High School, mostly in anonymity until Xavier University\'s basketball office began receiving anonymous calls stating that they should take a look at Grant. Xavier assistant coach Dino Gaudio finally scouted Grant, followed by visits from XU head coach Pete Gillen. Georgetown High\'s gymnasium has since been renamed Brian Grant Gymnasium. Grant played basketball at Xavier University, but the anonymity quickly faded. After four seasons at Xavier, Grant was second on the all-time leading scorers\' list with 1,719 points. He was twice named Midwest Collegiate Conference Player of the Year. All four seasons at Xavier he led the Musketeers in rebounding, and was third on the all-time leading rebounding list with 1,080. He was named to the Associated Press honorable mention All-American team in his junior year, after ranking second in the nation in field goal percentage with 65.4 percent. Grant was inducted into the Xavier Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999 and became one of only four basketball players to have his jersey retired, in a ceremony held in 2011. = Grant was selected in the first round, eighth overall, in the 1994 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings. In his rookie season he started in 59 out of 80 games, averaging 13.2 points a game with 7.5 rebounds. The following year, he started in 75 out of 78 games, increasing his scoring average to 14.4 points a game as the Kings made the playoffs. The Kings lost in four games to the top-seeded Seattle SuperSonics in the first round, with Grant averaging 9.8 points per game for the series. He signed a five-year, $29 million contract, but due to injuries appeared in only 24 games in the 1996–1997 season, and the Kings did not make the playoffs. = Grant opted out of the deal following the 1997 season to sign a six-year, $56 million deal with the Portland Trail Blazers. In his first year with the Trail Blazers he started in 49 of 61 games as the team made the playoffs but lost in the first round to the Los Angeles Lakers 3 games to 1. Grant averaged 13.2 points and 10.7 rebounds a game for the series. The 1998–1999 season was shortened to 50 games because of a league lockout, and Grant started 46 of 48 games with a scoring average of 11.5 points a game and a team high 9.8 rebounds per game. The Trail Blazers won the Pacific Division, swept the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the playoffs and defeated the previous Western Conference Champion Utah Jazz in six games in the second round. In the Western Conference Finals, the Trail Blazers were swept by the league-leading San Antonio Spurs. Grant started all 13 playoff games and averaged 13.2 points with 9.2 rebounds. Prior to the 1999–2000 season, Portland acquired veteran all-star Scottie Pippen, and coach Mike Dunleavy decided to use Grant as a reserve behind rising all-star Rasheed Wallace, who would go on to have a career year during the season as the Trail Blazers won 59 games and the second seed in the Western Conference. Portland opened the playoffs with a 3–1 first-round win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, with Grant and Wallace both being used as defensive options against Kevin Garnett. Grant was used in a similar fashion against Karl Malone and the Utah Jazz in the second round, with Portland advancing in five games. In the Western Conference Finals, the Trail Blazers faced the Los Angeles Lakers led by Pippen\'s former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson and the duo of Shaquille O\'Neal and Kobe Bryant. The teams split the first two games before the Lakers took games 3 and 4 to take a 3–1 series lead, but Portland responded with a win on the road in game 5 and a home win in the sixth game to set up a seventh game with a trip to the NBA Finals on the line. Despite taking a double-digit lead into the fourth quarter, the Lakers rallied and won the game, eliminating Portland. Grant averaged 5.4 points and 5.8 rebounds throughout the 2000 playoff run. After two years as the starting PF and one year as the Blazers\' number one big man off the bench, Grant once again opted out of his deal to become a free agent, hoping to land a starting job elsewhere. Grant made an appearance (albeit as an in game model) in a memorable Sega Dreamcast commercial in 1999 where he was seen talking to Sonic the Hedgehog character Tails. After the two-tailed fox said to Grant, ""Brian, you\'re going to get roofed."", Grant replied with, ""Shut up, quadruped."" = In the summer of 2000 Grant signed a 7-year $86 million deal with the Miami Heat, despite coming off season averages of 7.5 ppg and 5.5 rpg. The deal raised eyebrows, but Heat President and GM Pat Riley insisted that Grant was the missing piece to the Heat\'s championship puzzle, along with other recently acquired players Eddie Jones and Anthony Mason. Weeks before the start of the season Miami\'s all-star center Alonzo Mourning was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease forcing Riley to play Grant at center despite usually playing at the power forward position. Grant responded by putting up a career season of 15.2 ppg, 8.8 rpg, and a career high 79.7% at the foul line. Miami won 50 games, and Mourning returned to the team in late March, but were swept in the first round by the younger Charlotte Hornets. Grant averaged 10 points and 8 rebounds for the series. In the 2001–2002 season, with the anticipated return of Mourning to the lineup, Grant returned to his natural power forward position. Grant started in 72 games for Miami averaging 9.3 points and 8.0 rebounds a game for the season, but the Heat failed to reach the postseason. The next year signaled a rebuilding era for the team, as the Heat won just 25 games with Grant averaging 10.3 points a game along with a career high 10.2 rebounds, which placed him at fifth in the league in rebounds per game. He also finished the season 4th in total rebounds, 5th in defensive rebounds, and 10th in the league in field goal percentage at .509 percent, all personal bests. The Heat once again found themselves in the lottery, and would select Dwyane Wade in the draft to join sophomore Caron Butler before acquiring free agent Lamar Odom in the offseason. Alonzo Mourning, who did not play in the 2003 season, left the team and signed with the New Jersey Nets, leaving Grant as the team\'s best option at the center position. Just prior to the 2003–2004 season, another major franchise change occurred, as Pat Riley stepped down as coach.', 'In 2015, he was named the NBA Most Improved Player. After six seasons in Chicago, he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in June 2017, and was then again traded in November 2018, this time to the Philadelphia 76ers. In July 2019, he signed with the Miami Heat.', 'In the championship game against North Carolina State, Drexler failed to make an impact after picking up four fouls before halftime, and scored only four points on one-of-five shooting and two free throws in NC State\'s upset victory. Drexler declared for the NBA draft as a junior, leaving Houston with career averages of 14.4 points, 3.3 assists and 9.9 rebounds in three seasons. In addition to being named the Southwestern Conference Player of the Year and a first-team All American his final season, he remains the only player in school history with combined totals of at least 1,000 career points, 900 rebounds and 300 assists; he is also Houston\'s all-time steals leader with 268. = In the 1983 NBA draft, Drexler was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the 14th overall pick. He averaged 7.7 points in 17.2 minutes per game in his rookie season. These all improved with more playing time in his second season, to 17.2 points, 6 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 2.2 steals per game. In his third season Drexler made his first All-Star team, averaging 18.5 points, 5.6 rebounds, 8 assists and 2.6 steals. On January 6, 1989, Drexler scored a career-high 50 points during a double-overtime win over the Sacramento Kings. In the 1989–1990 season, Drexler led the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1990 NBA Finals, averaging 23.3 points, 6.9 rebounds and 5.9 assists during the season. The Blazers (ranked 3rd in the Western Conference) made it to the Conference Finals against the Phoenix Suns. While Drexler only led in scoring in the final two games, the Blazers were bolstered by players such as Terry Porter and Jerome Kersey to a six-game series victory, with Drexler and Porter each scoring 23 in the 112–109 victory that gave Portland its first conference championship since 1977. In the Finals, they played the Detroit Pistons. Drexler led the Blazers with 21 points in Game 1, but they lost 105–99. In Game 2, Drexler scored 33 points and contributed the go-ahead points in overtime by hitting two free throws with 2.1 seconds to beat Detroit 106–105. It was the only win in the series for the Blazers, who lost narrowly in Game 4 by three and lost the final game after Detroit went on a 9–0 run. During the 1990–1991 season, Drexler led Portland to a franchise-best 63–19 record. He played in every game for the first time in four seasons and averaged 21.5 points per game while having 6.7 rebounds and six assists on average. Heavily favored to win the West, the Los Angeles Lakers upset the Trail Blazers by winning the Western Conference Finals. In the 1991–92 season he made the All-NBA First Team and finished second to Michael Jordan in MVP voting, having averaged 25 points per game to go with 6.6 rebounds and 6.7 assists while playing slightly over 35 minutes a game; the Blazers finished 57–25, best in the Western Conference. The Blazers lost just twice in the first two rounds of the postseason, In the Conference Finals, they faced the Utah Jazz. Teammate Terry Porter cited Drexler decades later as the key guy to get the ball to when it came down to late in a game to make plays. Portland won the first two games at home before Utah responded with two victories in Utah. In Game 5, Portland won in overtime to set up a Game 6 in Utah. Porter and Drexler each scored 18 points in the pivotal Game 6 that the Blazers won 105–97 to clinch their second conference championship in three years. Drexler and the Blazers met Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the 1992 NBA Finals. In the Finals, Drexler was the leader or tied for the lead in scoring for the Blazers in each of the six games, leading all scorers once in Game 3 with 32 points in a 94–84 loss. Despite forcing a tie series twice, the Bulls pulled a comeback in the fourth quarter to turn a 15-point deficit into a win that clinched the series. In the six-game series against Chicago, Drexler averaged 24.8 points, 7.8 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game. Later that year, he was selected to the U.S. Olympic basketball team, nicknamed ""The Dream Team"", which won the gold medal in Barcelona. Drexler left as the all-time scoring leader for the Blazers with 18,040 points, which stood as a franchise record until Damian Lillard passed him in 2022. = On February 14, 1995, with the Blazers out of serious contention for a championship, Portland honored Drexler\'s request to be traded to a contender. They sent the Blazer great back home to the Houston Rockets, along with Tracy Murray in exchange for Otis Thorpe, the draft rights of Marcelo Nicola, and a 1995 first-round draft pick, right before the trade deadline. Despite finishing the regular season with a record of 47–35, which placed the Rockets 6th out of 8 playoff teams in the Western Conference, Drexler and long-time friend Hakeem Olajuwon helped propel them to an improbable second consecutive championship in 1995. On May 5, during the first round while down two games to one against the Utah Jazz, Drexler led the Rockets in scoring with 41 points while Olajuwon added 40 in a 123–106 win. Houston would go on to win the deciding Game 5, and then also win every remaining elimination game on their postseason run. In the finals, the Rockets swept the Orlando Magic. In his third and final NBA Finals appearance, Drexler averaged 21.5 points, 9.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists per game. Drexler played his last three full seasons with the Rockets. The 1995–96 season saw him average 19.3 points per game in 52 games played, owing to knee and ankle injuries. The Rockets dispatched their first-round opponent in the Lakers to face the Seattle SuperSonics. Drexler led the team in a variety of categories in the series such as rebounds (twice), points (twice), and assists (once), but the Sonics eliminated the Rockets in four games. The following year, the Rockets, having traded for Charles Barkley before the year started, went 21–2 to begin the year, but injuries would pile on the team, with Drexler having a hamstring injury; he was named to the All-Star Game, but he did not play in what ended up as his final selection. Drexler played a total of 62 games while averaging eighteen points a game with six rebounds and 5.7 assists. The Rockets finished 57-25 and made it all the way to the Conference Finals against the Jazz. The Rockets forced six games after winning Game 3 and 4, but the Jazz won in six to end the season. The 1997–98 season was his final season in the NBA. He played in 70 games and averaged 18.4 points a game with 4.9 rebounds (his lowest since his rookie year) and 5.5 assists.

However, Gordon and Rose developed chemistry playing with each other, and helped the Bulls finish the season on a 15–8 run to just qualify for the playoffs at 41–41. Entering the playoffs as the seventh seed and matched with the defending champion Boston Celtics, critics and observers expected the Bulls to be swept.

Following the success in the world championship, Rita was preparing for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. According to Rita: ""Everything was calculated, planned: Olympic Games, then - the increase of family, one year break and then back to sports again. But everything happened differently"" and she had to choose between her son and the Olympic Games. She decided to give birth to a child and give up the Olympic dream. Later on, the Soviet squad went on to win the Olympic gold medals in the Montreal Olympics and the national team\'s head coach shut the door for Rita Jasikevičienė to return into the national team in the future. However, Šarūnas\'s mother never regretted her decision. Šarūnas remembers that his mother constantly said: ""My son will give me back the Olympics"". In his childhood Šarūnas was a very agile child. His mother remembers that soon after learning to walk, Šarūnas immediately began to run leaning at 45 degrees. Rita: ""He was running and running everywhere and I had to constantly chase him"". The biggest penalty for Šarūnas was to sit. His younger brother Vytenis was slightly different though. He was slower, but both brothers were unable to live without a ball as kids. Jasikevičius\'s father Linas always was a sports lover and his son followed his lead to cheer for practically anything. Together they cheered for the USSR national teams or any athlete who had USSR written across his or her chest. Not surprisingly, his dad took him to his first basketball workout when he was 6 years old. His first coach was Feliksas Mitkevičius in Kaunas basketball school, who was strict and never chased Šarūnas when he tried to run away from workouts. According to Mitkevičius, when Šarūnas was 12 years old, he was so sick of basketball that he wished to drop it. He visited his parents, outlined the situation and stated that it would be a huge loss to Lithuania. Following it, his dad had some strong words for Šarūnas and forbade him to drop basketball, which he wished to replace with tennis. In Kaunas basketball school he met with future NBA star Žydrūnas Ilgauskas with whom he was meeting practically every day, at school, in the gym or elsewhere for the next eleven years. Tomas Masiulis was another notable player on his team. Jasikevičius remembers that at first he was seen as the guy who was ""talented but lazy"" as he was not a committed athlete; all he did was joke around and try to work as little as possible. Consequently, on one occasions, his dad stopped him from going on a trip to Minsk with the team, a trip of the sort that only happens once a year, as his marks were disastrous and it was a punishment: ""No school? So no basketball"".', ""Edey is listed at 7 feet 4 inches (2.24 m), making him the tallest player in Big Ten history.

Jones played for the Ball High School Golden Tornadoes basketball team. He went on to the University of Houston after his graduation in 1994. A journeyman throughout his career, Jones never played for the same team for more than one season except for 2005–2008, when he played for the Cleveland Cavaliers. In his career, he played for ten different teams. Jones was most notable for his ability to make three-point field goals. In fact, three-point attempts made up the majority of his field goal attempts because his role was often to wait on the outside while teammates such as Shaquille O\'Neal, Dwyane Wade, or LeBron James forced double teams. Jones was supremely confident of his shot, once proclaiming that he is ""the best shooter in the world."" = Jones played for the Idaho Stampede of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) during the 1998–99 season. He was selected as the CBA Newcomer of the Year and named to the All-CBA First Team. = Prior to the 2004–2005 season, Jones signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract with the Miami Heat. Jones then proceeded to have the best statistical season of his career, setting career highs in games started (66), minutes played (2,576), field goals made (331) and attempted (726), field goal percentage (45.6%), three-point field goals made (225) and attempted (521), three-point field goal percentage (43.2%), free throws made (68) and attempted (86), rebounds (231), steals (44), blocked shots (5) and points scored (955). His 225 three-point field goals made was third best in the NBA (and at the time, tied with Mitch Richmond for the ninth most ever in an NBA season) and his three-point field goal percentage was fifth best that season. Jones had a career-high 31 points on February 16, 2005, against the Los Angeles Clippers and scored in double figures on 48 occasions. He also had his only game with two blocked shots on March 10, 2005, against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Jones grabbed a career-high eight rebounds on November 6, 2004, against the Washington Wizards, a mark he tied on February 22, 2005, against the Chicago Bulls.

Barkley was invited by Bob Knight to try out for United States men\'s basketball team for the 1984 Summer Olympics. He made it all the way to final cuts, but was not selected for the team, despite outplaying almost all of the front-court players there. According to Knight, Barkley was cut because of poor defense. Barkley competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games and won two gold medals as a member of the United States men\'s basketball team. International rules that previously prevented NBA players from playing in the Olympics were changed in 1992, allowing Barkley and fellow NBA players to compete in the Olympics for the first time. The team was nicknamed the ""Dream Team"" and went 6–0 in the Olympic qualifying tournament and 8–0 against Olympic opponents. The team averaged an Olympic record 117.3 points a game and won games by an average of 43.8 points, only surpassed by the 1956 U.S. Olympic team. Barkley led the team with 18.0 points on 71.1% field goal shooting and set a then-Olympic single-game scoring record with 30 points in a 127–83 victory over Brazil. He also set a U.S. Men\'s Olympic record for highest three-point field goal percentage with 87.5% and added 4.1 rebounds and 2.6 steals per game. During the game versus Angola, Barkley elbowed Herlander Coimbra in the chest and was unapologetic after the game, claiming he was hit first. Barkley was called for an intentional foul on the play. Coimbra\'s resulting free throw was the only point scored by Angola during a 46–1 run by the U.S. At the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games, Barkley led the team in scoring, rebounds, and field goal percentage. He averaged 12.4 points on 81.6% field goal shooting, setting a U.S. Men\'s Olympic record. In addition, he also contributed 6.6 rebounds per game. Under Barkley\'s leadership, the team once again compiled a perfect 8–0 record and captured gold medal. Barkley played the power forward position, but occasionally played small forward and center. He was known for his unusual build as a basketball player, stockier than most small forwards, yet shorter than most power forwards he faced. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his unusual combination of strength and agility. Barkley was a prolific scorer who averaged 22.1 points per game during the regular season for his career and 23.0 points per game in the playoffs for his career. Barkley was an incredibly efficient offensive force, leading the NBA in 2-point field goal percentage every season from the 1986–87 season to the 1990–91 season. He led the league in effective field goal percentage in both the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons as well, and also led the league in offensive rating in both the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons. He was one of the NBA\'s most versatile players and accurate scorers capable of scoring from anywhere on the court and established himself as one of the NBA\'s premier clutch players. During his NBA career, Barkley was a constant mismatch because he possessed a very uncommon combination of skills and could play in a variety of positions. He would use all facets of his game in a single play; as a scorer, he had the ability to score from the perimeter and the post, using an array of spin moves and fadeaways, or finishing a fast break with a powerful dunk. He was one of the most efficient scorers of all time, scoring at 54.13% total field goal percentage for his season career and 51.34% total field goal shooting for his playoff career (including a career-high season average of 60% during the 1989–90 NBA season). Barkley is the shortest player in NBA history to lead the league in rebounding when he averaged a career-high 14.6 rebounds per game during the 1986–87 season. His tenacious and aggressive form of play built into an undersized frame that fluctuated between 284 pounds (129 kg) and 252 pounds (114 kg) helped cement his legacy as one of the greatest rebounders in NBA history, averaging 11.7 rebounds per game in the regular season for his career and 12.9 rebounds per game in his playoff career and totaling 12,546 rebounds for his season career. Barkley topped the NBA in offensive rebounding for three straight years and was most famous among very few power forwards who could control a defensive rebound, dribble the length of the court and finish at the rim with a powerful dunk. Barkley also possessed considerable defensive talents led by an aggressive demeanor, foot speed and his capacity to read the floor to anticipate for steals, a reason why he established his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power forward position and leader of the highest all-time steal per game average for the power forward position. Despite being undersized for both the small forward and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in blocked shots. His speed and leaping ability made him one of the few power forwards capable of running down court to block a faster player with a chase-down block. In a SLAM magazine issue ranking NBA greats, Barkley was ranked among the top 20 players of All-Time. In the magazine, NBA Hall-of-Famer Bill Walton commented on Barkley\'s ability. Walton stated, ""Barkley is like Magic [Johnson] and Larry [Bird] in that they don\'t really play a position. He plays everything; he plays basketball.', ""He ranked second on the Hawks in rebounding (6.9 rpg) and steals (135). For the first of two straight seasons, he led the NBA in field-goal attempts, with 1,891. After going 0-for-11 from the three-point line the previous season, Wilkins made 25 of 81 three-point shots in 1984–85. He also shot better than 80 percent from the free throw line for the first of 10 consecutive seasons. Despite Wilkins's efforts, Atlanta finished 34–48 and failed to reach the playoffs. Wilkins exploded into the NBA's elite circle in 1985–86, winning the league scoring title with an average of 30.3 points per game. He was an NBA All-Star for the first time and was voted to the All-NBA First Team at the end of the season."", ""Chris Raymond Gatling (born September 3, 1967) is an American former professional basketball player. Gatling played for many National Basketball Association (NBA) teams from 1991 to 2002. He played for the US national team in the 1990 FIBA World Championship, winning the bronze medal. Gatling played three years at Old Dominion University after transferring there from the University of Pittsburgh. He is ODU's sixth all-time scorer with 1,811 points.

Gatling is the school's all-time field goal percentage leader at .606 (697–1150), and is second all-time at ODU with (12) 30-point games. He shot .620 (251–405) from the field in 1991. Gatling scored 36 points in a game against UNC Charlotte in 1991 and against Alabama-Birmingham in March 1989. He earned honorable mention All-American honors in 1990 and 1991. Gatling was named sophomore of the year in 1988, and then Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year in both 1990 and 1991. In 1991, he was named the Sun Belt Conference tournament Most Valuable Player as he led the then seventh seeded Monarchs to the finals before losing to South Alabama. Gatling was drafted 16th overall by the Golden State Warriors in the 1991 NBA draft. He spent the first four years of his career with the Warriors, and averaged 13.7 points and 7.6 rebounds per game in his final full season with the Warriors, 1994–95. That same year, Gatling led the NBA in field goal percentage at 0.633-one of the ten highest percentages in NBA history.

He played for the U.S. national team in the 2002 FIBA World Championship. = On February 24, 2005, Davis was traded from the Hornets to the Golden State Warriors for guard Speedy Claxton and veteran forward Dale Davis after tension with the Hornets\' coaching staff and several nagging injuries. The move created one of the more potent backcourts in the NBA with Davis and star guard Jason Richardson. It also saw Davis\'s return to California, where he had craved to return since his college days at UCLA. After two seasons in which the Warriors underachieved under coach Mike Montgomery, the Warriors hired former coach Don Nelson for the 2006–07 season. His high-scoring offensive system was designed to fit Davis\'s up-tempo style. Although Davis suffered through knee soreness and underwent surgery during the season, he still led the league in steals per game and the Warriors to their first playoff appearance since 1994. The Warriors swept the regular season series against the Mavericks 3–0, giving them an advantage and won the series against the top-seeded Dallas Mavericks 4–2, making them the first No. 8 seed to beat a No. 1 seed since the NBA changed the 1st round from a 5-game series to a 7-game series. It was numerically the largest upset in the history of the NBA playoffs, with the 67–15 Mavericks\' regular-season win–loss record 25 games better than the 42–40 Warriors\'. Davis averaged 25 points per game in the series. Steve Kerr, then television analyst, called Davis\'s performance in the 2007 NBA playoffs ""outrageous...stunningly athletic and creative and explosive."" Davis\'s playoff highlights included numerous acrobatic layups, a buzzer-beating half-court three-pointer, and a memorable dunk over Andrei Kirilenko. The Utah Jazz eliminated the undersized Warriors 4 games to 1. Davis averaged 25.3 points, 6.5 assists, 2.9 steals, and 4.5 rebounds per game in the 2007 Playoffs. In 2008, during a playoff elimination game against the Phoenix Suns, Coach Nelson benched Davis at halftime due to his poor play (shooting 2–13 in 17 minutes). Down fourteen at the half, the Warriors lost by six. Some sportswriters criticized Nelson\'s decision to bench his team\'s star with an entire half left to play; other writers speculated about possible friction between Davis and Nelson, which Nelson denied. After the 2007–08 season, in which the Warriors were narrowly edged out of playoff contention despite a record of 48–34 (led by Davis—who remained injury-free throughout the season—with averages of 21.8 PPG, 7.6 assists, 2.3 steals, 4.6 RPG), Davis\'s agent Todd Ramasar stated that Davis might opt out of his contract with the Warriors, which would have paid him $17.8 million, to pursue other options. On June 30, 2008, Davis opted out of his contract with the Golden State Warriors. = On July 1, 2008, Davis verbally agreed to a 5-year, $65 million deal to play for his hometown team, the Los Angeles Clippers, and officially signed with the Clippers on July 10, 2008. Davis initially decided to join the Clippers with the intent of playing with Elton Brand, but Brand shockingly opted out of his contract to sign with the Philadelphia 76ers. After officially signing with the Clippers, Davis said that Brand\'s departure had no impact on his decision to come to Los Angeles. Prior to Davis\'s arrival, the Clippers had never even won their division or conference, and had only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice since entering the league in 1970. Davis promised to change that, and despite Brand\'s departure, Clippers fans remained excited to have a star who could compete with crosstown rival Kobe Bryant\'s popularity. Davis\'s first year with the Clippers was marked with a series of injuries and disappointments, as the Clippers struggled to a 19–63 record in which Davis was only able to play 65 games, and saw his points per game average and field goal percentage take a steep decline. Despite this, Davis did produce a few bright spots on the year. On November 22, he scored 30 points and handed out 10 assists in a game against the New Jersey Nets.', 'His scoring and rebounding averages for the 1989–90 through 1991–92 seasons were close to 20 and 8, respectively, and he helped his team to consecutive 50-win seasons and playoff appearances.', ""in Greece and Philips Milano in Italy. Davis is also the former president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA). On October 31, 2012, ESPN announced the hiring of Davis as a studio analyst for NBA broadcasts. He is also currently a co-host/analyst on SiriusXM NBA Radio. Davis played college basketball at UTEP under coach Don Haskins from 1986 to 1990. Teaming up with fellow future NBA-All star Tim Hardaway, Davis helped the Miners win 25 games and earn the seventh seed in the 1987 NCAA tournament as they defeated the number ten seed Arizona in overtime by a score of 98–91; they would, however, lose in the second round to Iowa by a score of 84–82. The next year, Davis started 30 games and averaged nearly 10 points with 6 rebounds as the Miners won 23 games and again advanced to the tournament, only to lose to number nine seed Seton Hall by a score of 80–64. As a junior, Davis averaged 14 points (second to Hardaway) with 8 rebounds a game as the Miners won 26 games and again gained the seventh seed, in the 1989 NCAA tournament, where they defeated number 10 seed LSU by a score of 85–74, only to lose in the second round to second-seeded Indiana by a score of 92–69. In Davis' senior year, (despite the departure of Hardaway to the NBA) the Miners still won 21 games, with Davis averaging 10 points and 7 rebounds a game; they would lose to the number six seed coming out of the tournament that year, Minnesota. After four seasons at UTEP, Davis declared for the 1990 NBA draft. Davis was drafted by the Indiana Pacers in the second round, 45th overall of the 1990 NBA draft. He initially went on to play with professional teams in Europe, rather than play in the NBA. He played with Panathinaikos in the Greek League from 1990 to 1992, and with Philips Milano of the Italian League, during the 1992–93 season. Davis also played in Europe's 3rd-tier level league, the FIBA Korać Cup, with both teams and while he was with Milano, he won the Korać Cup championship in the 1992–93 season. = Indiana Pacers In 1993, Davis returned to the United States to play in the NBA for the 1993–94 season when he signed with the Indiana Pacers as a free agent. As a rookie off the bench, Davis played in 81 games and helped the Pacers to the playoffs where they swept the Orlando Magic in three straight games then upset the top-seeded Atlanta Hawks in six games in the first two rounds en route to facing the Patrick Ewing-led New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Pacers dropped the first two games in New York before rebounding to take the next two in Indiana; in game five in New York teammate Reggie Miller scored 25 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Pacers to the victory. The Pacers then returned to Indianapolis with the chance to clinch the Eastern Conference title but lost both game six and the series. The next year the Pacers won 52 games and the Central Division title thanks to the addition of Mark Jackson; Davis meanwhile played in 44 games averaging 7.6 points a game with 6.4 rebounds a game as he missed significant time due to injury. In the playoffs the Pacers faced the Atlanta Hawks for the second consecutive season. The Pacers swept the Hawks in three straight games, then found themselves in a rematch with the Knicks in the second round; in game one (which saw the ejections of Davis and Derek Harper) teammate Reggie Miller made a three-pointer and then stole the inbounds pass and tied the game with another three-pointer right in front of Knicks fan Spike Lee who was just a few feet away. Miller added 2 free throws and gave the Pacers a comeback win. The Pacers lost Game 2 and the series returned to Indiana. After four games, the Pacers took a 3–1 series lead; however, the Knicks bounced back and forces the seventh game at Madison Square Garden. The Pacers emerged victorious as Patrick Ewing's last-second shot did not go in the basket. With a 1-point win, the Pacers qualified for the Eastern Conference Finals for the second consecutive season. As with their first and second-round opponents, the Pacers played a young talented Orlando Magic team led by Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway in a rematch of the previous postseason. The Pacers pushed Orlando to a 7th game before losing the series. The following season was the most challenging in franchise history but despite that the Pacers duplicated their record from the previous season, 52–30, with Davis averaging 8.8 points a game with 6.1 rebounds a game. In the playoffs, the Pacers were defeated by the sixth-seeded Atlanta Hawks in five games. In the 1996–97 season the Pacers finished sixth in the Central Division with a record of 39–43 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 1989 despite Davis playing in 82 games, starting 28 of them and averaging 10.5 points with 7.3 rebounds a game. The next year the Pacers bounced back and won 58 games and the second seed in the Eastern Conference (with the additions of former Boston Celtics player Larry Bird as head coach and veteran all-star Chris Mullin) with Davis playing in 82 games for the third year in a row while starting 12 of them and averaging 9.6 points a game and 6.8 rebounds a game, in the postseason the Pacers defeated the Shawn Kemp-led Cleveland Cavaliers and Ewing-led New York Knicks in the first two rounds before being matched up with the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals, after losing the first two games in Chicago, the Pacers responded by winning games three and four to forced a deciding game five back in Chicago, a game in which the Bulls won by a score of 106–87 to force a deciding sixth game back in Indiana, game six would be a hard-fought game in which the Pacers won by a score of 92–89 to send the series back to the United Center in Chicago for a deciding seventh game of the series, in game seven the Pacers fought and claw their way to every possession but it was not enough in the end as the eventual champion Bulls still prevailed by a score of 88–83 to win the series. The Pacers entered the season as a heavy favorite because Michael Jordan had retired and other members of the Chicago Bulls were broken up by their management. After a four-month lockout, the Pacers won the Central Division with a record of 33 wins and 17 losses and although he was unable to break into the first team Davis still averaged 9.4 points a game, with 7.0 rebounds a game solidifying his role as rebounder shot blocker and inside scorer. In the playoffs the Pacers swept the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round, and the Philadelphia 76ers in the semifinals advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals for the second consecutive season, and for the fourth time in six seasons. Once again, the Pacers were up against the New York Knicks. Each game was nip and tuck with both teams trading wins as the Knicks won games one, three (a game best-remembered for Davis fouling Larry Johnson on a four-point play) and five while the Pacers won games two and four to set up a sixth game back at Madison Square Garden in New York. After fighting their way through most of the first three quarters the Pacers lost game six and the series to the Knicks, (marking the second year in a row and fourth overall that the Pacers lost in the Eastern Conference Finals). With a couple of Eastern Conference Finals disappointments coupled with Davis begging for more playing time, Davis announced his intentions to be traded. = 1999–2000 season On August 1, 1999, Davis was traded to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for the 5th pick of the 1999 NBA draft in high schooler Jonathan Bender. In the 1999–00 season he solidified his role as a starter and started almost all 79 games that he appeared in. He averaged 11.5 points, 8.8 rebounds with 1.3 blocks for the Raptors as they won 45 games and advanced to the playoffs for the first time in franchise history where they faced a strong, talented New York Knicks team now led by Ewing, Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston in the first round. The Knicks swept the Raptors in three games, despite Davis averaging 13.0 points with 8.3 rebounds and 1.3 blocks a game. 2000–2001 season In the 2000–01 season, Davis had his most productive season yet, averaging 13.7 points, with 10.1 rebounds plus 1.4 blocks a game and was elected to the NBA All-Star Team for the first and only time in his career. That season the Raptors won 47 games, good enough for second place in the Central Division and advanced to the playoffs for the second year in a row, where they faced a talented Knicks team led by Sprewell and Houston and no longer featured Ewing. The Raptors defeated the Knicks in five games including a 93–89 game five victory with 14 points, 12 rebounds, and 2 blocks from Davis. In the second round, the Raptors matched up against the top-seeded Philadelphia 76ers led by league MVP Allen Iverson and defensive lynchpin Dikembe Mutombo. Every game was neck and neck with both teams trading wins in the first six games of the series, especially a game six win by the Raptors featuring a score of 101–89 with Davis scoring 17 points, grabbing 13 rebounds and blocking 2 shots despite being bothered by a strained triceps muscle in his left arm. In-game seven (a game that would prove to be the most memorable of the series), the first three quarters were nip and tuck with both teams trading leads entering the fourth quarter, and although the Raptors lost game seven to the Sixers by a score of 88–87 and the series, Davis, for the most part, enjoyed a very good series averaging 16.9 points with 11.1 rebounds and 1.8 blocks a game. 2001–2002 season The 2001–02 season however would be even better for Davis as he averaged his most points per game for a season yet at 14.5 points, with 9.6 rebounds and 2.0 blocks a game. Although they regressed from 47 wins from a year ago to 42, the Raptors still advanced to the playoffs for the third year in a row, where they faced their Central Division rivals (also great lakes rivals) the Detroit Pistons led by All-star Jerry Stackhouse and rebounding specialist Ben Wallace in the first round. After losing the first two games in Detroit, the Raptors responded by winning the next two games in Toronto, including a 94–84 game three victory thanks to a 30-point 8 rebound performance from Davis to send the series back to Detroit for a deciding game 5. That would prove to be the most memorable game of the series. The game was nip and tuck with both teams trading leads throughout the game and although the Raptors lost Game 5 to the Pistons by a score of 85–82 and the series, Davis enjoyed his best playoff series yet as he increased his playoff production to 17.0 points with 10.6 rebounds and 1.0 blocks a game. 2002–2003 season The 2002–03 season would prove to be the most difficult season for the Raptors in franchise history as they struggled with injuries all season long and sputtered to a 24–58 record, missing the playoffs for the first time since 1999 despite Davis averaging 13.9 points with 8.2 rebounds a game. 2003–2004 season In the 2003–04 season despite being bothered by trade rumors, Davis still averaged double-doubles for stretches of the season including 14 points with 12 rebounds in a home win against the New Jersey Nets, followed by 13 points with 12 rebounds in a home win against the Dallas Mavericks and finally 10 points with 11 rebounds in a road win against the Atlanta Hawks and his last game with the Raptors against the Orlando Magic, Davis scored 15 points and grabbed 8 rebounds in a road win against the Magic, thus ending an era of Toronto Raptors basketball in which had relied on him as a second-leading scorer, rebounder and defensive presence inside. = That season, he was traded to the Chicago Bulls, where he fit in well as a veteran influence on a young team that included Tyson Chandler, Eddy Curry and Kirk Hinrich, although his overall averages decreased from previous years Davis continued to be relied on for his scoring, rebounding and shot-blocking and in the 2004–05 season, Davis averaged 7.0 points with 5.9 rebounds for the season as the Bulls won 47 games and advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1998 where they faced the Washington Wizards led by Gilbert Arenas, Antawn Jamison, and Larry Hughes in the first round, the Bulls would lose to the Wizards in six games. Davis averaged 9.5 points a game with 6.8 rebounds in 6 playoff games. That summer Davis was elected the President of the NBA Players' Association at the union's annual convention on June 28, 2005. = Just before the start of the training camp of the 2005–06 season, Davis was traded along with Curry to the New York Knicks for Michael Sweetney, Tim Thomas and Jermaine Jackson. Through 36 games with the Knicks, Davis averaged 5.0 points with 4.8 rebounds a game. Davis had a season-high of 14 rebounds along with 3 points and 1 assist in a loss against the Wizards and had 11 points and five rebounds with 2 assists and 2 steal as the Knicks defeated the Bulls by a score of 109–101, then a few weeks later he had 11 points again with 9 rebounds as the Knicks defeated the Mavericks by a score of 117–115. Fan incident On January 18, 2006, Davis was ejected from a Knicks-Bulls game for going into the stands and confronting a fan he alleges was intoxicated and abusive. He said he was concerned about his wife, whom he thought he had seen falling back and being touched by the fan. His wife claims that the fan was using inappropriate language around the Davis' child and that she had asked him to stop, which then prompted harassment from the fan. Though public opinion allegedly swung in Davis' favor, the NBA suspended him for five games on January 19. The fan in question, Michael Axelrod, the son of David Axelrod, the 2008 campaign manager for Barack Obama, has stated that he was attacked by Davis' wife, and his lawyer revealed plans to sue for roughly a million dollars and a public apology by the Davis family. Mr."", ""Davis was sidelined in the subsequent contest. He was a finalist for December Western Conference Player of the Month. On February 6, despite having missed his last 11 three-point shots and having a career 2-for-23 three-point career record, Davis made a game-winning three-point buzzer beater against Oklahoma City Thunder as part of a 41-point, 10-rebound double-double. The 41-point performance marked a New Orleans record 13th consecutive 20-point performance, surpassing Pete Maravich of the 1976–77 New Orleans Jazz. On February 7, 2015, Davis injured his shoulder after falling off the rim when he received an alley-oop. As a result of the injury, he withdrew from the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, and was replaced on the roster by Dirk Nowitzki and in the starting lineup by LaMarcus Aldridge. Davis missed five games in late February and early March to the shoulder sprain. He returned against the Detroit Pistons with a very dominant game performance of 39 points, 13 rebounds and 8 blocks, numbers that only Hakeem Olajuwon and Dwight Howard had achieved in a game in the prior 30 years. Davis also reached 437 career blocks, a franchise record. On March 9, Davis tied his career high with 43 points and added 10 rebounds, 2 blocks and a steal in a 114–103 win against the Milwaukee Bucks. On March 15 in a double overtime game against the Denver Nuggets, Davis became the first player in NBA history to tally 36 points, 14 rebounds, 9 blocks and 7 assists in a game since blocks became a statistic in 1973. Only David Robinson has had at least 30 points, 11 rebounds, 8 blocks and 7 assists in a game. On March 16, Davis earned Western Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, March 9, through Sunday, March 15 and was a finalist for Western Conference Player of the Month of March. In the final game of the regular season, a must-win game that would send the Pelicans to the 2015 NBA playoffs, Davis recorded 31 points, 13 rebounds and 3 blocks in a 108–103 victory over the defending-champion San Antonio Spurs. The playoff berth was Davis's first and the franchise's first since 2011. Davis's season was one of the most impressive in NBA history, finishing the season averaging 24.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 2.9 blocks, and leading the league in player efficiency rating with 30.89. He was a finalist for Western Conference Player of the Month again in April. In his first career playoff series, Davis averaged 31.5 points, 11.0 rebounds and 3.0 blocks per game. Although swept by the overall number one seeded Golden State Warriors, who went on to win the NBA championship, Davis joined Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Karl Malone as the only players in the past 20 seasons to average 30 points and 10 rebounds in the playoffs. Davis also became the first player in 40 years to average 30 points and 10 rebounds in a player's first playoff series, with the only other players to do so being Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bob McAdoo. At the end of the season, Davis finished 4th in the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting, 5th in the NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting, sixth in the NBA Most Improved Player Award voting. He was selected to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career, becoming the first player to make the first team in his first three seasons since Derrick Rose did so in the 2010–11 NBA season. He was also an NBA All-Defensive Team second team selection. Season-ending injury (2015–2016) On July 9, 2015, Davis signed a five-year, $145 million contract extension with the Pelicans.

Davis also became just the 20th player in NBA history to score at least 59 points in a game, and became the youngest player in NBA history to score 59 points in a game, and the second youngest (behind Bob McAdoo) to record 50 points and 20 rebounds in a game. The 59 points was an NBA-wide season high at the time. The total was not surpassed until the final night of the season when Kobe Bryant posted 60 in his final career game. Davis posted a third 40-point game (40 points and 13 rebounds) on March 9 against the Charlotte Hornets.

Despite joining a Cavaliers team who at the time of the trade had the worst record in the NBA (which included a record-setting 26-game losing streak), Davis helped the Cavaliers close the season with several victories, including a 102–90 upset victory over LeBron James and the Miami Heat, to ensure that Cleveland did not have the worst record in the league at the season's end. On December 14, 2011, the Cavaliers waived Davis via the amnesty clause. He still made the $30 million over the two years left on his contract, but it did not count against Cleveland's salary cap. The Cavaliers had drafted Kyrie Irving with their first overall pick, and wanted to give him the starting point guard spot, allowing Davis to seek a starting job on a contending team. The Knicks, Heat and Lakers were in the market for a point guard at the time. = On December 19, 2011, Davis signed a one-year contract with the New York Knicks, choosing New York over the Lakers and Heat who also expressed interest in signing Davis. At the time of the signing, Davis had a herniated disk in his back. He did not make his debut for the Knicks until February 20, 2012, coming off the bench to score a three-pointer along with an assist.

He made a return to the basketball court in July 2015, scoring 44 points in the Drew League (which was the subject of his documentary The Drew: No Excuse, Just Produce), and subsequently announced his interest in returning to the NBA. On January 15, 2016, he signed a contract to play in the NBA Development League, and on March 2, he was acquired by the Delaware 87ers. Two days later, he made his D-League debut in a 114–106 loss to the Iowa Energy, recording eight points, one rebound, four assists and three steals in 19 minutes off the bench.

However, on July 27, 2016, Harkless signed a four-year, $40 million contract to remain with the team. After experimenting with various lineups early in the preseason, coach Terry Stotts quickly settled back on Harkless as the starting small forward, a position he would hold on to for the majority of the season.

Prior to the start of the 2013–14 season, Paul re-signed with the Clippers for five years on a contract worth approximately $107 million. Despite a shoulder injury that sidelined him for over a month, Los Angeles set another new franchise record for wins with 57.

In Game 1 of the second round of the playoffs, he hit a career postseason-high eight three-pointers to help the Clippers take an early series lead over the Oklahoma City Thunder.

The Clippers ultimately decided to trade Paul because they were unwilling to offer him the contract extension that he was seeking and they did not want to lose him for nothing once he became a free agent. Paul, who was interested in playing alongside superstar guard James Harden, opted into the final year of his existing contract to facilitate the trade.

After initially playing backup to Antonio Daniels, Parker became a starter and made 77 regular-season appearances in his rookie season, averaging 9.2 points, 4.3 assists and 2.6 rebounds in 29.4 minutes per game. When he played against the Los Angeles Clippers on 30 October 2001, he became the third French player to play in an NBA game, after Tariq Abdul-Wahad and Jérôme Moïso. By the end of the season, the rookie led San Antonio in assists and steals, and was named to the All-Rookie First Team for 2001–02, becoming the first foreign-born guard to earn the honor. In 2002–03, Parker played in all 82 regular-season games as San Antonio\'s starting point guard on a team that was largely revamped from previous years. He improved his regular season statistics, averaging 15.5 points per game (ppg), 5.3 assists per game (apg) and 2.6 rebounds per game (rpg). Parker\'s role as the team\'s playmaker was reflected in his leading the team in assists on 49 occasions. During the 2003 NBA All-Star Weekend, Parker represented the Sophomores in the Rookie Challenge, and also participated in the inaugural Skills Challenge. In the post season, the Spurs, led by Tim Duncan, defeated the New Jersey Nets 4–2 in the finals, and Parker earned his first NBA championship ring. Despite the victory, Parker struggled with inconsistent play throughout the playoffs, and was often benched in favor of more experienced guards Steve Kerr and Speedy Claxton late in the games. Second championship (2003–2005) Despite winning a championship with the Spurs, doubts lingered over Parker\'s future. The Spurs had attempted and failed to acquire New Jersey Nets\' Jason Kidd, but Parker told coach Popovich that he wanted to be San Antonio\'s starting point guard. Parker played well during the regular season, recording 14.7 ppg, 5.5 apg and 3.2 rpg. However, the Spurs were defeated by the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference semi-finals in the 2004 NBA Playoffs, and were denied back-to-back titles. Prior to the start of the 2004–05 season, Parker signed a six-year, $66 million contract extension through the 2010–11 season. On the year, he would once again record improved regular season statistics, tallying 16.6 ppg, 6.1 apg and a career-high 3.7 rpg. He was also ranked 13th in the league in total assists, and was third among point guards in field goal percentage. The Spurs were strong in the playoffs, and Parker was instrumental in the victories over the Denver Nuggets, Seattle SuperSonics and Phoenix Suns. However, Parker struggled in the Finals series against the Detroit Pistons. Spurs colleagues Manu Ginóbili and Brent Barry often took over playmaking duties as Parker was unable to perform as well as he did in the regular season. Nevertheless, the Spurs won their third-ever NBA championship by defeating the defending champions 4–3 in the 2005 NBA Finals. Third championship (2005–2007) Parker was selected for the first time in his career an NBA All-Star for the 2005–06 season as he managed 18.9 ppg and an impressive .548 in field goal percentage. Parker\'s scoring average was even higher than Duncan\'s, and his form propelled the Spurs to a 63–19 win–loss record and qualification for the 2006 NBA Playoffs. However, the top-seeded Spurs were again unable to win back-to-back titles as they were eliminated in the second round by the Dallas Mavericks. On 14 February 2007, after delivering consistent numbers in the first half of the 2006–07 season, Parker was selected to play in the 2007 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve guard. With Parker operating as the starting point guard in the 2006–07 season, the Spurs qualified for the 2007 NBA Playoffs and finished second in the Southwest Division. In the Western Conference Semifinals, the Spurs met the Phoenix Suns led by two-time and reigning NBA MVP Steve Nash. After eliminating the Suns, the Spurs defeated the Utah Jazz 4–1 to win the Western Conference Finals. Parker and the Spurs went on to face the Cleveland Cavaliers and swept them 4–0 to win the 2007 NBA Finals. In this series, Parker consistently outplayed his Cavaliers counterparts Daniel Gibson and All-Defensive Team member Larry Hughes and scored a series-high 24.5 points, accompanied by a high field goal percentage of 56.8% and of 57.1% from three-point range. For his performances, he was named the 2007 NBA Finals MVP, becoming the first European-born player to receive the award. Falling short and injury (2007–2011) In the 2007–08 regular season, Parker recorded similar averages as the previous two seasons for points and rebounds, and slightly increased his assists per game average. The Spurs finished third in the Western Conference and faced the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 2008 NBA Playoffs. For the third time in four years, San Antonio prevailed over Phoenix; Parker had an outstanding first-round series, averaging nearly 30 points and 7 assists a game. In the next round against Chris Paul\'s New Orleans Hornets, the Spurs dropped the first two road games before responding with a strong win in the third game. In that game, Parker recorded a double-double with 31 points and 11 assists. The experienced Spurs took seven games to defeat the Hornets, but were unable to get past the Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals, and the Spurs once again failed to win back-to-back NBA championships. San Antonio got off to a rocky start in their 2008–09 NBA season, losing the first three contests. In their fourth game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, however, Parker scored a career-high 55 points to lead the Spurs to their first victory of the campaign. The Spurs recovered soon enough, and approached the All-Star break ranked second in the Conference. With Parker averaging a career-high in points per game, he was named as a reserve for the 2009 All-Star game. The Spurs were without influential shooting guard Ginóbili for much for the season, and greater responsibility fell on Parker\'s shoulders. He helped lead the team to a 54–28 record and the third seed for the playoffs, In Game 4 of the first round against Dallas, Parker matched George Gervin\'s franchise playoff record for points in a half with 31. However, the Spurs eventually lost 4–1, bowing out of the playoffs in the first round for the first time since 2000. Parker\'s 28.6 points and 4.2 rebounds per game broke his previous playoffs career-best averages of 22.4 points and 3.7 rebounds. On 13 May 2009, he was named to the All-NBA Third Team. With the Spurs looking to provide a more solid supporting cast in the 2009–10 season, they acquired Richard Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Antonio McDyess, DeJuan Blair, and Keith Bogans. Parker injured his hand during the season and missed 26 games. The Spurs qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed, and defeated Dallas 4–2 in the first round, only to lose 4–0 to Phoenix in the next round. Going into the final season of his contract, Parker would sign a four-year, $50 million extension at the start of the 2010–11 season, keeping him in San Antonio through the 2014–15 season.. To start the season, the Spurs compiled a 12-game winning streak to go 13–2 after 15 games. The Spurs were 29–4 after 33 games—one of the ten best starts in NBA history–and led the league at 35–6 halfway through the season. Parker and the Spurs ended the regular season as the first seed in the West for the 2011 NBA playoffs, and were second in the league (to Chicago). Despite finishing with a 61–21 record, however, the Spurs could not avoid being upset in the first round, 4–2, by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies. = During the 2011 NBA lockout, Parker signed with LDLC ASVEL, the French basketball team in which he owns a stake.

Jones played for the Ball High School Golden Tornadoes basketball team. He went on to the University of Houston after his graduation in 1994. A journeyman throughout his career, Jones never played for the same team for more than one season except for 2005–2008, when he played for the Cleveland Cavaliers. In his career, he played for ten different teams. Jones was most notable for his ability to make three-point field goals. In fact, three-point attempts made up the majority of his field goal attempts because his role was often to wait on the outside while teammates such as Shaquille O\'Neal, Dwyane Wade, or LeBron James forced double teams. Jones was supremely confident of his shot, once proclaiming that he is ""the best shooter in the world."" = Jones played for the Idaho Stampede of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) during the 1998–99 season. He was selected as the CBA Newcomer of the Year and named to the All-CBA First Team. = Prior to the 2004–2005 season, Jones signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract with the Miami Heat. Jones then proceeded to have the best statistical season of his career, setting career highs in games started (66), minutes played (2,576), field goals made (331) and attempted (726), field goal percentage (45.6%), three-point field goals made (225) and attempted (521), three-point field goal percentage (43.2%), free throws made (68) and attempted (86), rebounds (231), steals (44), blocked shots (5) and points scored (955). His 225 three-point field goals made was third best in the NBA (and at the time, tied with Mitch Richmond for the ninth most ever in an NBA season) and his three-point field goal percentage was fifth best that season. Jones had a career-high 31 points on February 16, 2005, against the Los Angeles Clippers and scored in double figures on 48 occasions. He also had his only game with two blocked shots on March 10, 2005, against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Jones grabbed a career-high eight rebounds on November 6, 2004, against the Washington Wizards, a mark he tied on February 22, 2005, against the Chicago Bulls. In 15 playoff games, Jones averaged 12.1 points and 4.0 assists, and shot 42.9% from three-point range.

Barkley was invited by Bob Knight to try out for United States men\'s basketball team for the 1984 Summer Olympics. He made it all the way to final cuts, but was not selected for the team, despite outplaying almost all of the front-court players there. According to Knight, Barkley was cut because of poor defense. Barkley competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games and won two gold medals as a member of the United States men\'s basketball team. International rules that previously prevented NBA players from playing in the Olympics were changed in 1992, allowing Barkley and fellow NBA players to compete in the Olympics for the first time. The team was nicknamed the ""Dream Team"" and went 6–0 in the Olympic qualifying tournament and 8–0 against Olympic opponents. The team averaged an Olympic record 117.3 points a game and won games by an average of 43.8 points, only surpassed by the 1956 U.S. Olympic team. Barkley led the team with 18.0 points on 71.1% field goal shooting and set a then-Olympic single-game scoring record with 30 points in a 127–83 victory over Brazil. He also set a U.S. Men\'s Olympic record for highest three-point field goal percentage with 87.5% and added 4.1 rebounds and 2.6 steals per game. During the game versus Angola, Barkley elbowed Herlander Coimbra in the chest and was unapologetic after the game, claiming he was hit first. Barkley was called for an intentional foul on the play. Coimbra\'s resulting free throw was the only point scored by Angola during a 46–1 run by the U.S. At the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games, Barkley led the team in scoring, rebounds, and field goal percentage. He averaged 12.4 points on 81.6% field goal shooting, setting a U.S. Men\'s Olympic record. In addition, he also contributed 6.6 rebounds per game. Under Barkley\'s leadership, the team once again compiled a perfect 8–0 record and captured gold medal. Barkley played the power forward position, but occasionally played small forward and center. He was known for his unusual build as a basketball player, stockier than most small forwards, yet shorter than most power forwards he faced. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his unusual combination of strength and agility. Barkley was a prolific scorer who averaged 22.1 points per game during the regular season for his career and 23.0 points per game in the playoffs for his career. Barkley was an incredibly efficient offensive force, leading the NBA in 2-point field goal percentage every season from the 1986–87 season to the 1990–91 season. He led the league in effective field goal percentage in both the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons as well, and also led the league in offensive rating in both the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons. He was one of the NBA\'s most versatile players and accurate scorers capable of scoring from anywhere on the court and established himself as one of the NBA\'s premier clutch players. During his NBA career, Barkley was a constant mismatch because he possessed a very uncommon combination of skills and could play in a variety of positions. He would use all facets of his game in a single play; as a scorer, he had the ability to score from the perimeter and the post, using an array of spin moves and fadeaways, or finishing a fast break with a powerful dunk. He was one of the most efficient scorers of all time, scoring at 54.13% total field goal percentage for his season career and 51.34% total field goal shooting for his playoff career (including a career-high season average of 60% during the 1989–90 NBA season). Barkley is the shortest player in NBA history to lead the league in rebounding when he averaged a career-high 14.6 rebounds per game during the 1986–87 season. His tenacious and aggressive form of play built into an undersized frame that fluctuated between 284 pounds (129 kg) and 252 pounds (114 kg) helped cement his legacy as one of the greatest rebounders in NBA history, averaging 11.7 rebounds per game in the regular season for his career and 12.9 rebounds per game in his playoff career and totaling 12,546 rebounds for his season career. Barkley topped the NBA in offensive rebounding for three straight years and was most famous among very few power forwards who could control a defensive rebound, dribble the length of the court and finish at the rim with a powerful dunk. Barkley also possessed considerable defensive talents led by an aggressive demeanor, foot speed and his capacity to read the floor to anticipate for steals, a reason why he established his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power forward position and leader of the highest all-time steal per game average for the power forward position. Despite being undersized for both the small forward and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in blocked shots. His speed and leaping ability made him one of the few power forwards capable of running down court to block a faster player with a chase-down block. In a SLAM magazine issue ranking NBA greats, Barkley was ranked among the top 20 players of All-Time. In the magazine, NBA Hall-of-Famer Bill Walton commented on Barkley\'s ability. Walton stated, ""Barkley is like Magic [Johnson] and Larry [Bird] in that they don\'t really play a position.

Spencer attended the University of Louisville, where he played college basketball for the Louisville Cardinals. He became the all-time field goal percentage leader at 62.8%. He took over the center position as a senior in 1989–90 after Pervis Ellison left to join the NBA. That season Spencer paced the Cardinals in scoring (14.9 ppg), rebounding (8.5 rpg), blocked shots (69), and field goal percentage (68.1%). The Minnesota Timberwolves selected Spencer in the first round, with the sixth overall pick, in the 1990 NBA draft. As a rookie, Spencer split time at center with 7-foot-3-inch (2.21 m) veteran Randy Breuer, but still managed respectable numbers, averaging 7.1 points and 7.9 rebounds per game, and shooting 51.2% from the floor.

Additionally, he blocked 121 shots, establishing a single-season record for the young franchise that would stand until Kevin Garnett's rookie season in 1995–96. For his efforts, Spencer was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team that year."", 'Reid and Sedale Threatt as well as Paspalj\'s old Yugoslav national teammate Jure Zdovc. Paspalj spent the 1996–97 season in Paris, leading the club to its first national title in 43 years. During this period, he averaged 12 points per game and shot over 80 percent from the free throw line, indicating that his shooting confidence was returning. = Paspalj returned to Greece, his second home, for the 1997–98 season and signed for Aris. This grand old club throughout the 1980s, had fallen on hard times, and was about to embark on one of the most difficult seasons of its history. His return to the A1 League was marked by an excellent performance against Larissa, scoring 23 points on 5/6, 6/13, 2/3, suggesting that Paspalj had regained his shooting confidence. Paspalj\'s free throw shooting, in particular, was more consistent than at any time since the dramatic deterioration of his statistics in 1994. Paspalj had some memorable performances in the autumn of 1997, including 18 points (6/6, 6/9) in a 63–56 home victory over Panathinaikos, and a game against PAOK when he steered Aris to victory with 20 points (2/2, 9/11) in the first round and another stellar performance in the second round of the championship. He also played particularly well against his old clubs, Olympiacos and Panathinaikos, and began scoring once again with three-point shots as in his heyday in the early 1990s. Two three-pointers against PAOK in the return game, which Aris also won, proved the point, as Paspalj dominated his young compatriot, Peja Stojaković, who was about to leave Greece for a stellar career in the NBA. Against Olympiacos, at a time when Aris was in economic crisis and many of its players had left the club, Paspalj top-scored 23 points (with 11/15 free throws) as he steered the team to a memorable 82–76 victory. He scored a season-high 26 points in a Korać Cup game early in December 1997. In February 1998 Paspalj, playing injured, led his team to victory in the Greek Cup, scoring 12 points (2/5, 5/10) but the majority of his teammates left the club the following day after having gone without payment for some time. Paspalj remained, but an injury meant that he did not play again that season after mid-February as Aris alarmingly dropped down the table and narrowly avoided relegation to the A2 league. His final two performances in the Greek League for Aris came in a 101–59 point humbling at Peristeri when he finished with 4 points, followed by a 72–49 win over Sporting in which he ended with 6 points, and in his last game for the club (in the Korać Cup) he ended with 18 points (8/10, 4/10, 0/4) in a defeat in Rome. = In the summer of 1998 Paspalj secured a move to the newly crowned European champions, Kinder Bologna, allegedly as a favour to Predrag Danilović, Paspalj\'s great friend and a star on the team. However, effects of past injuries and years of chain-smoking caught up with him and he was cut from the team in December on medical advice from his doctor and after a series of undistinguished performances and an average of 8.2 points per game and 4 rebounds per game in domestic play. Paspalj\'s best performance came when he scored 18 points (2/3, 8/11) against Rimini in October, while his last game in professional basketball came on December 20, 1998, when he scored 7 points (1/1, 3/4) in 13 minutes\' play against Verona. During this period he had one final appearance in front of his old Olympiacos fans, in a EuroLeague game in October 1998, scoring 2 points (0/2 1/5), but by this time Paspalj was a shadow of his former self and struggled to keep up with the pace of games. Paspalj did not at the time believe himself to have retired and harbored hopes of returning to basketball, and gave an interview to Greek television in July 1999, in which he stated his intent to play again and the possibility that he might obtain Greek citizenship to ease the process, as teams were restricted to the number of non-EU players they could sign. Neither panned out, with Paspalj recounting in a 2023 Greek television interview how no team had wanted him, and the tragedy for basketball was that a player of his caliber was unable to continue to perform at a professional level and was lost to the sport at the age of 32, but for Paspalj himself a personal near-tragedy was still to come. Summing up his 14+1⁄2 seasons in professional basketball, Paspalj is remembered for a successful globetrotting career that included a multitude of trophies and individual awards. Perhaps the single most memorable aspect of his game is the off-balance, unorthodox sling-style shooting technique he perfected — a move that served him so well in the first part of his career, but deserted him later on. An interview with Paspalj in November 2015 for a Greek television station elicited a deluge of messages from viewers who continued to recall Paspalj with tremendous affection two decades later. Paspalj returned to Piraeus and his old Olympiakos home in September 2017 to attend a benefit game in honor of the legendary Yugoslav coach Dusan Ikvovic, and received a rapturous welcome from fans of his former club. = Talented 17-year-old small forward Paspalj, playing in Budućnost\'s youth categories at the time, got his first taste of the Yugoslav national team system in summer 1983 when he was picked by head coach Rusmir Halilović to represent the country at the European Championship for Cadets in the West German towns of Tübingen and Ludwigsburg. Being on a squad alongside fellow youngsters such as Jure Zdovc, Bane Prelević, Miroslav Pecarski, Ivo Nakić, and Luka Pavićević, Paspalj had a solid tournament, recording 14.6 points per game, just behind the team\'s leading scorer Ivica Mavrenski (18.4 ppg). Yugoslavia went on to win the title, beating Greece in the semifinal and Spain (led by Antonio Martín, Aitor González de Zarate, and Rafa Jofresa) in the final. A year later, 18-year-old Paspalj was picked again by Halilović, this time for the 1984 European Championship for Juniors in Huskvarna and Katrineholm, Sweden. Playing on a team alongside old national cadet teammates Mavrenski, Pavićević, Zdovc, Nakić, and Pecarski as well as new teammates Zoran Jovanović, Velimir Perasović, Mirko Milićević, Franjo Arapović, and Ivica Žurić, Paspalj starred again. The team won bronze by beating Spain after losing the semifinal versus the Soviet Union by 19 points. = Partizan FIBA Korać Cup (1): 1988–89 Yugoslav League (1): 1986–87 Yugoslav Cup (1): 1988–89 Olympiacos Greek League (2): 1992–93, 1993–94 Greek Cup (1): 1993–94 Racing Paris French League (1): 1996–97 Aris Greek Cup (1): 1997–98 Paspalj also participated in EuroLeague Final Fours on three occasions, with three different teams. In 1988, he was part of the young Partizan squad that came in third place. In 1994, he led Olympiacos to the final, but couldn\'t make the last step. The very next season (1995), he was there again, this time with Panathinaikos, but they finished in third place. = 1989 EuroBasket: Gold 1990 FIBA World Championship: Gold 1991 EuroBasket: Gold 1995 EuroBasket: Gold In addition, Paspalj won two Olympic silver medals (1988, 1996), as well as a bronze medal at the 1987 EuroBasket. = In March 2001, over two years since retiring from playing professional basketball and just shy of his 35th birthday, Paspalj suffered a mild heart attack while playing recreational football with friends in Athens. Not realizing what had happened, he went back to his Glyfada home where, while showering after football, he reportedly started feeling severe fatigue along with strong burning sensation in his lungs at which point he called a doctor. Once at the hospital, his heart attack was diagnosed and he remained hospitalized for about a week at Athens\' Asklipieio General Hospital of Voula where he got advised to fundamentally change his lifestyle, including quitting smoking and reducing sports-related physical activity to a minimum. By own admission, Paspalj completely ignored the doctor\'s advice, soon suffering another heart attack, this time a more serious one, while playing tennis several months later in July 2001. One year after that, during summer 2002, he experienced two more similar episodes that required hospitalization and stints in intensive care — first in June 2002 in Athens and then two months later on 18 August 2002 in Belgrade while playing outdoor pickup basketball with friends who reacted quickly and got him to a hospital where he got placed in intensive care at the cardiology unit of Belgrade\'s Urgentni centar. In October 2005, during a discussion on RTS television\'s Ključ programme regarding coronary issues, he stated that two heart attacks weren\'t enough to force him into quitting smoking or into substantially changing his lifestyle. In a November 2007 interview on the same television (Balkanskom ulicom programme) he admitted to still smoking, though adding he cut back on it significantly and is in the process of phasing it out completely. In November 2017, Paspalj was reported to have suffered a stroke while visiting San Antonio. After spending some time in hospital, Paspalj moved to the home of San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, where he was visited by his former teammate Vlade Divac, who reported that the worst had passed but that Paspalj was only beginning to communicate again. = In the early 2004 he became team manager for the Serbia-Montenegro national squad, working under head coach Željko Obradović who had just come back to the national team following a four-year absence. The most important aspect of Paspalj\'s job was helping create the right atmosphere by acting as a liaison between the head coach and the players. The thinking was that such a well-liked former player would have a soothing effect on the damaged inter-squad relations. Paspalj was also entrusted with the role of convincing different players, especially ones from the NBA, to come play for the national team. Unfortunately, his time at the post coincided with two of the team\'s worst performances in recent history as S&M finished 11th (out of 12 squads) at the 2004 Athens Olympics and then failed to reach the quarter-finals of the 2005 European Championships held on home soil in Serbia. He resigned after the second failure, citing health reasons and a desire to spend more time with his wife and daughters. = Paspalj also decided to try his hand at business by investing heavily in the ambitious Aqua Park project in New Belgrade\'s Blok 44. The construction started in fall 2005. Initial projection of a summer 2006 opening turned out to be too optimistic, so, according to Paspalj, the new target for grand opening moved to the summer of 2007, however even that wasn\'t to be. He eventually pulled out of the venture in December 2007, which is when the project was taken over by Novi Sad based Genel company. = In February 2009, after Vlade Divac won the presidency of the Serbian Olympic Committee, he appointed Paspalj to be his second in command.

His nickname came as a result of his grandmother\'s calling him ""Pretty"" with a southern drawl, thus sounding like ""Penny"". He wore #1 on his jersey in part because a penny is worth one cent. Hardaway\'s first love was football, but his grandmother did not want him to get hurt. He was raised in the Binghampton neighborhood of shotgun houses in Memphis. As a teenager, Hardaway refereed youth sports at the Memphis YMCA and played on its Jr. Olympic basketball team. Hardaway grew up playing basketball in Memphis for Treadwell High School where he averaged 36.6 points, 10.1 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 3.9 steals, and 2.8 blocks as a senior and was named Parade Magazine National High School player of the year. He finished his high school career with 3,039 points. At Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis), Hardaway had to sit out the 1990–91 season with the Memphis State Tigers due to being academically ineligible according to the Proposition 48 regulation. His grades were so low that he was admitted to the university on a special exemption from University President Thomas G.', ""Anthony commuted to Towson Catholic High School for his first three years of high school. During the summer of 1999, Anthony grew 5 inches (130 mm) into the frame of a 6-foot-5-inch (1.96 m) swingman. He became one of the area's top players and made a name for himself in the area, being named The Baltimore Sun's metro player of the year in 2001, as well as Baltimore Catholic League player of the year. During his sophomore year, he averaged 14 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals. Towson Catholic surged to a record of 26–3 and finished third in the state tournament. Anthony enjoyed a successful high school basketball career as a junior, almost doubling his numbers in scoring and rebounds, averaging 23 points and 10.3 rebounds. Despite his successful year, Anthony was distracted by all of the attention and was suspended on several occasions for skipping classes. He barely registered a blip on the radars of pro scouts with his skinny frame and lack of strength; many scouts felt that he was not ready for the physical demands of the NBA. In the end, Towson Catholic fell short of the state title, although he was named Baltimore's County Player of the Year, All-Metropolitan Player of the Year and Baltimore Catholic League Player of the Year. After his junior year, Division I coaches were lined up to recruit Anthony to a school on the East Coast, which included North Carolina and Syracuse. In contrast to contemporary prep-to-pro players like Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady or Amar'e Stoudemire, he decided to declare early and announce that he would attend Syracuse University before his senior year. As Anthony's grades dropped under a C average and his scores on the ACT were below acceptable standards, he knew that he needed to improve in the classroom to qualify academically for Syracuse."", 'He then enrolled in the College of Southern Idaho as a freshman in the 1999–2000 season and transferred to play college basketball at Fordham University.

How does Dennis Rodman believe most people around the country or world view him?,"['Dennis Rodman, of all people. Keeping us safe is really not my job; it\'s the black guy\'s [Obama\'s] job. But I\'ll tell you this: If I don\'t finish in the top three for the next Nobel Peace Prize, something\'s seriously wrong."" On September 3, 2013, Rodman flew to Pyongyang for another meeting with Kim Jong Un. He said that Kim has a daughter named Kim Ju Ae, and that he is a ""great dad"". He also noted that he planned to train the North Korean national basketball team. He stated that he is ""trying to open Obama\'s and everyone\'s minds"" and encouraged Obama to reach out to Kim Jong Un. In December 2013, Rodman announced that he would visit North Korea again. He also said that he has plans to take a number of former NBA players with him for an exhibition basketball tour. According to Rory Scott, a spokesman for the exhibitions\' sponsoring organization, Rodman planned to visit December 18–21 and train the North Korean team in preparation for January games. The games were scheduled for January 8 (Kim Jong Un\'s birthday) and January 10, 2014. Included on the U.S. exhibition team were Kenny Anderson, Clifford Robinson, Vin Baker, Craig Hodges, Doug Christie, Sleepy Floyd, Charles D. Smith, and four streetballers. Rodman departed from Beijing on January 6. Among his entourage was Irish media personality Matt Cooper, who had interviewed Rodman a number of times on the radio. Rodman made comments on January 7, 2014, during a CNN interview implying that Kenneth Bae was at fault for his imprisonment. The remarks were widely reported in other media outlets and provoked a storm of criticism. Two days later, Rodman apologized for his comments, saying that he had been drinking and under pressure. He added that he ""should know better than to make political statements"". Some members of Congress, the NBA, and human rights groups suggested that Rodman had become a public relations stunt for the North Korean government. On May 2, 2016, Kenneth Bae credited Rodman with his early release. He said that Rodman\'s rant raised awareness of his case and that he wanted to thank him for his expedited release. On June 13, 2017, Rodman returned to North Korea on what was initially described as a sports-related visit to the country. ""My purpose is to go over there and try to see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea,"" he said. He added that he hoped to accomplish ""something that\'s pretty positive"" during the visit. He met with national Olympic athletes and basketball players, viewed a men\'s basketball practice, and visited a state-run orphanage. He was not able to meet with Kim Jong Un, but met instead with the nation\'s Minister of Sports and gave him several gifts for Kim, including two signed basketball jerseys, two soap sets, and a copy of Donald Trump\'s 1987 book The Art of the Deal. Rodman posted a video on Twitter that was recorded before he left for the visit in which he and his agent describe the mission of the trip. ""He\'s going to try to bring peace between both nations,"" said Rodman\'s agent Chris Volo, referring to the strained relations between North Korea and the United States.

Rich invited Rodman to his rural Oklahoma home; at first, Rodman was not well-received by the Riches due to the fact he was 22 years old and black, but the Riches were so grateful to him for bringing their son out of his shell that they were able to set aside their prejudices. Although Rodman had severe family and personal issues himself, he ""adopted"" the Riches as his own in 1982 and went from the city life to ""driving a tractor and messing with cows"". Though Rodman credited the Riches as his ""surrogate family"" that helped him through college, as of 2013 he had stopped communicating with the Rich family after Byrne\'s mother allegedly referred to Rodman as a ""nigger"". = Early years and first championship (1986–1989) Rodman made himself eligible for the 1986 NBA draft. He was drafted by the Detroit Pistons as the third pick in the second round (27th overall), joining the rugged team of coach Chuck Daly that was called ""Bad Boys"" for their hard-nosed approach to basketball. The squad featured Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars at the guard positions, Adrian Dantley and Sidney Green at forward, and center Bill Laimbeer. Bench players who played more than 15 minutes per game were sixth man Vinnie Johnson and the backup forwards Rick Mahorn and John Salley. Rodman fit well into this ensemble, providing 6.5 points, 4.7 rebounds and some tough defense in 15.0 minutes of playing time per game. Winning 52 games, the Pistons comfortably entered the 1987 playoffs. They swept the Washington Bullets and soundly beat the Atlanta Hawks in five games but bowed out in seven matches against the archrival Boston Celtics in what was called one of the physically and mentally toughest series ever. Rodman feuded with Celtics guard Dennis Johnson and taunted Johnson in the closing seconds when he waved his right hand over his own head. As the Celtics closed out Game Seven, Johnson went back to Rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture. After the loss, Rodman made headlines by saying Celtics star Larry Bird was overrated because he was white. ""Larry Bird is overrated in a lot of areas....Why does he get so much publicity? Because he\'s white.', 'We\'re trying to bring everything together. If not, at least we tried."" The visit was sponsored by the cryptocurrency company PotCoin. Rodman\'s ""hoops diplomacy"" inspired the 20th Century Fox comedy Diplomats. Tim Story and Peter Chernin are set to produce the film, while Jonathan Abrams is reportedly writing the script. Rodman visited North Korea again in June 2018. ""I\'m just happy to be a part of"" the 2018 North Korea–United States summit, he said, ""because I think I deserve it."" There has been speculation that Rodman might be an intelligence officer working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on North Korea, with the CIA neither confirming nor denying existence of records concerning his employment. Presidential involvement suggested The Washington Post raised the question of whether President Donald Trump sent Rodman on his 2017 visit to negotiate the release of several American prisoners of North Korea or to open a back channel for diplomatic communications. The U.S. State Department, White House officials, and Rodman all denied any official government involvement in the visit. Rodman, who publicly endorsed Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, is a self-described longtime friend of the president and, as the article put it, ""Trump and Kim\'s only mutual acquaintance."" The Washington Post article stated, ""Multiple people involved in unofficial talks with North Korea say that the Trump administration has been making overtures toward the Kim regime, including trying to set up a secret back channel to the North Korean leader using \'an associate of Trump\'s\' rather than the usual lineup of North Korea experts and former officials who talk to Pyongyang\'s representatives."" When asked if he had spoken with Trump about the visit, Rodman replied, ""Well, I\'m pretty sure he\'s pretty much happy with the fact that I\'m over here trying to accomplish something that we both need."" Rodman publicly presented a copy of Trump\'s book, The Art of the Deal to North Korean officials, as a personal gift for Kim Jong Un. In a Twitter video posted by Rodman, his agent Chris Volo said, ""He\'s the only person on the planet that has the uniqueness, the unbelievable privilege of being friends with President Trump and Marshal Kim Jong Un."" Rodman went on to say in the video that he wanted to bring peace and ""open doors between both countries."" Otto Warmbier, an American student held captive in North Korea for 17 months, was released to U.S. officials the same day as Rodman\'s visit to North Korea.', 'In February 2017, Irving stated in an interview for a podcast that he believes that the Earth is flat. In a later interview, Irving was less forceful in advancing his flat Earth belief, encouraging people to ""do their own research"" into the topic. In September 2017, Irving denied these claims and said that media misunderstood him as he was joking. However, in a June 2018 interview, when asked if he would admit that the world is round, he said, ""I don\'t know. I really don\'t"", and added that people should ""do [their] own research for what [they] want to believe in"" because ""Our educational system is flawed"". In October 2018, Irving apologized for his original flat Earth comments but stopped short of saying whether he still believed that the Earth is flat. Irving also stated that he believes in other conspiracy theories, such as the idea that John F.', 'Dennis Keith Rodman (born May 13, 1961) is an American former professional basketball player. Renowned for his defensive and rebounding abilities, his biography on the official NBA website states that he is ""arguably the best rebounding forward in NBA history"". Nicknamed ""the Worm"", he played for the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs, Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, and Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Rodman played at the small forward position in his early years before becoming a power forward. He earned NBA All-Defensive First Team honors seven times and won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice. He also led the NBA in rebounds per game for a record seven consecutive years and won five NBA championships. On April 1, 2011, the Pistons retired Rodman\'s No. 10 jersey, and he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame later that year. In October 2021, Rodman was honored as one of the league\'s greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. Rodman experienced an unhappy childhood and was often described as shy and introverted in his early years. After aborting a suicide attempt in 1993, he reinvented himself as a ""bad boy"" and became notorious for numerous controversial antics. He repeatedly dyed his hair in artificial colors, had many piercings and tattoos, and regularly disrupted games by clashing with opposing players and officials. He famously wore a wedding dress to promote his 1996 autobiography Bad as I Wanna Be. Rodman also attracted international attention for his visits to North Korea and his subsequent befriending of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2013.

When he was young, his father left his family, eventually settling in the Philippines. Rodman has many brothers and sisters: according to his father, he has either 26 or 28 siblings on his father\'s side. However, Rodman has stated that he is the oldest of a total of 47 children. After his father left, Shirley took many odd jobs to support the family, up to four at the same time. In his 1996 biography Bad As I Wanna Be, he expresses his feelings for his father: ""I haven\'t seen my father in more than 30 years, so what\'s there to miss ... I just look at it like this: Some man brought me into this world. That doesn\'t mean I have a father"".', 'The U.S. State Department said the release of Warmbier was negotiated and secured by high level U.S. diplomats including Joseph Yun, the State Department\'s special envoy on North Korea. Warmbier, who was in a nonresponsive coma throughout much of his imprisonment in North Korea, died days after being returned to his family in the U.S. In an emotional interview with Michael Strahan of Good Morning America, Rodman expressed sorrow for the death of Warmbier and said, ""I was just so happy to see the kid released. Later that day, that\'s when we found out he was ill. No one knew that."" He added that he wished to give ""all the prayer and love"" to the Warmbier family and had contacted them and hoped to meet with them personally. Rodman\'s agent, Chris Volo, told ABC News that before they left for the 2017 trip, he had asked North Korean officials to release Warmbier as a symbol of good faith for any future sports-relations visits. ""I asked on behalf of Dennis for his release three times,"" Volo said. In December 2017, Columbia University professor of neurobiology Joseph Terwilliger, who has accompanied Rodman to North Korea, argued that ""While I don\'t suspect that very many Americans would have chosen him to be an emissary or international goodwill ambassador, Dennis has had a long friendship with Mr. Trump and has also developed a very cordial friendship with Mr.', ""Despite the timeline of the two events, the U.S. State Department, The White House, and Rodman all flatly denied any diplomatic connection or coordination between Rodman's visit and the U.S. government."", 'Bryant was also a fan of soccer teams Barcelona, AC Milan, and Manchester City. According to Forbes, at the time of his retirement, Bryant\'s $680 million in career earnings was the most ever by a team athlete during their playing career. Bryant was a second cousin of his former Lakers teammate Cedric Ceballos. Sexual assault case In the summer of 2003, the sheriff\'s office of Eagle, Colorado, arrested Bryant in connection with an investigation of a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee. Bryant had checked into The Lodge and Spa at Cordillera in Eagle County in advance of undergoing knee surgery nearby. The accuser stated that Bryant raped her in his hotel room the night before he was to have the procedure. Bryant admitted to an adulterous sexual encounter with his accuser but denied her sexual assault allegation. Bryant was charged on June 18, 2003. The accusation had a negative impact on Bryant\'s reputation, and the public\'s perception of him plummeted; his endorsement contracts with McDonald\'s and Nutella were terminated. Sales for Bryant\'s replica jersey fell significantly. In September 2004, the assault case was dropped by prosecutors after the accuser decided not to testify at the trial. Afterward, Bryant agreed to apologize to her for the incident, including his public mea culpa: ""Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.""

In an NBA Together Virtual Roundtable held in May 2020, Lin further spoke out against anti-Asian racism, stating: ""All it would take is 10 seconds to put yourself in the position of someone who is dealing with racism or somebody who is legitimately contemplating whether to go to the grocery store to get food for themselves or to not because they\'re afraid of being attacked. ...', 'Most people around the country, or around the world, are basically working people who want to be free, who want to be themselves.

Despite spurts of inefficient, turnover-prone play, Jackson proved a capable playmaking option, with above-average passing abilities and court vision. Larry Brown, a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame and former head coach of the Charlotte Bobcats, readily acknowledged Jackson\'s ability: ""You ask anyone in the league – Stephen is an elite player. He\'s as bright as anyone I\'ve coached."" Former Golden State Warriors head coach Don Nelson, the second most winning coach in NBA history, summarized Jackson\'s game: ""I don\'t think that people realize how good a player Jackson is, he guards every night, he makes plays, he can shoot, and the only thing that he doesn\'t do is rebound. He makes everyone around him better."" Jackson\'s coach during his Indiana days, Rick Carlisle, described Jackson as a ""terrific all-around player... He\'s an experienced guy, strong and quick. He has a good understanding of the game on the defensive side of the ball."" NBA legend and former Pacers president Larry Bird called Jackson the toughest player in the league, regarding injuries and subsequently playing through the pain. Bird also praised Jackson\'s ability to ""do every aspect of the game at a high level.""

In August 1999, Rodman was arrested for public drunkenness and spent the night in jail after he got into an altercation at Woody\'s Wharf in Newport Beach, California. The charges were eventually dropped. On November 5, 1999, Rodman and his then-wife, Carmen Electra, were charged with misdemeanor battery after police were notified of a domestic disturbance. Each posted bail worth $2,500 and were released with a temporary restraining order placed on them. The charges were dropped the next month.

In May 2019, the Los Angeles Times reported that Newport Beach yoga studio owner Ali Shah accused Rodman of helping steal over $3,500 worth of items from the studio\'s reception area, including a 400 lb (180 kg) decorative geode. Rodman disputed the account, claiming the owner told him ""Dennis, get anything you want."" No charges had been filed at the time of reporting. On October 18, 2019, Rodman was charged with misdemeanor battery after slapping a man at the Buddha Sky Bar in Delray Beach, Florida. Rodman was one of the victims of professional scam artist/fraudster Peggy Ann Fulford (Peggy King, Peggy Williams, Peggy Ann Barard, etc.), losing $1.24 million, amongst the $5.79 million in total she stole from him, Ricky Williams, Travis Best, Rashad McCants, Lex Hilliard and others. Fulford\'s crimes included stealing funds Rodman believed were being distributed as child-support payments he owed to his first wife, contributing to an unsuspecting Rodman – in 2012 – being left trying to explain the missed payments in an Orange County, California, court; the issue was clarified when Fulford was indicted by the FBI in 2016. She continued her criminal activity until sentenced, in February 2018, to 10 years in prison and full financial restitution (unlikely) to her victims. = On July 24, 2015, Rodman publicly endorsed Donald Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign.

Trump 2016."" In 2020, Rodman endorsed and campaigned for the presidential campaign of rapper Kanye West. In 2024, Rodman endorsed Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. = On February 26, 2013, Rodman made a trip to North Korea with Vice Media correspondent Ryan Duffy to host basketball exhibitions. He met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Rodman and his travel party were the first Americans to meet Kim. He later said that Kim was ""a friend for life"" and suggested that President Barack Obama ""pick up the phone and call"" Kim, since the two leaders were basketball fans. On May 7, after reading an article in The Seattle Times, Rodman sent out a tweet asking Kim to release American prisoner Kenneth Bae, who had been sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in North Korea. Kim released Bae the following year. In July 2013, Rodman told Sports Illustrated: ""My mission is to break the ice between hostile countries. Why it\'s been left to me to smooth things over, I don\'t know.', 'You never hear about a black player being the greatest"". Although teammate Thomas supported him, he endured harsh criticism, but avoided being called a racist because, according to him, his own girlfriend Anicka ""Annie"" Bakes was white. In the following 1987–88 season, Rodman steadily improved his stats, averaging 11.6 points and 8.7 rebounds and starting in 32 of 82 regular season games. The Pistons fought their way into the 1988 NBA Finals, and took a 3–2 lead, but lost in seven games against the Los Angeles Lakers. In Game Six, the Pistons were down by one point with eight seconds to go; Dumars missed a shot, and Rodman just fell short of an offensive rebound and a putback that could have won the title. In Game Seven, L.A. led by 15 points in the fourth quarter, but Rodman\'s defense helped cut down the lead to six with 3:52 minutes to go and to two with one minute to go. But then, he fouled Magic Johnson, who hit a free throw, missed an ill-advised shot with 39 seconds to go, and the Pistons never recovered. In that year, he and his girlfriend Annie had a daughter they named Alexis. Rodman remained a bench player during the 1988–89 season, averaging 9.0 points and 9.4 rebounds in 27 minutes, yet providing such effective defense that he was voted into the All-Defensive Team, the first of eight times in his career. He also began seeing more playing time after Adrian Dantley was traded at midseason to Dallas for Mark Aguirre. In that season, the Pistons finally vanquished their playoffs bane by sweeping the Boston Celtics, then winning in six games versus the Chicago Bulls—including scoring champion Michael Jordan—and easily defeating the Lakers 4–0 in the 1989 NBA Finals. Rodman was hampered by back spasms but dominated the boards, grabbing 19 rebounds in Game 3 and providing tough interior defense. Second championship and rebounding titles (1989–1993) In the 1989–90 season, Detroit lost perennial defensive forward Rick Mahorn, who was taken by the Minnesota Timberwolves in that year\'s expansion draft and ended up on the Philadelphia 76ers when the Pistons could not reacquire him. It was feared that the loss of Mahorn – average in talent, but high on hustle and widely considered a vital cog of the ""Bad Boys"" teams – would diminish the Pistons\' spirit, but Rodman seamlessly took over his role. Averaging 8.8 points and 9.7 rebounds while starting in the last 43 regular-season games, he established himself as the best defensive player in the game, lauded by the NBA ""for his defense and rebounding skills, which were unparalleled in the league"". Rodman\'s feats drew him his first big individual accolade: the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. He also had a .595 field goal percentage, best in the league. In the 1990 playoffs, the Pistons beat the Bulls again, and in the 1990 NBA Finals, Detroit met the Portland Trail Blazers. Rodman suffered from an injured ankle and was often replaced by Mark Aguirre, but even without his defensive hustle, Detroit beat Portland in five games and claimed their second title. During the 1990–91 season, Rodman finally established himself as the starting small forward of the Pistons. He played such strong defense that the NBA said he ""could shut down any opposing player, from point guard to center"". After coming off the bench for most of his earlier years, he started in 77 of the 82 regular-season games, averaged 8.2 points and 12.5 rebounds, and won his second Defensive Player of the Year Award. In the 1991 playoffs, the Pistons were swept by the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Bulls went on to win the championship. In the 1991–92 season, Rodman made a remarkable leap in his rebounding. He collected an astounding 18.7 per game, winning his first of seven consecutive rebounding crowns, along with scoring 9.8 points per game, and making his first All-NBA Team. His 1,530 season rebounds (the most since Wilt Chamberlain\'s 1,572 in the 1971–1972 season) have not since been surpassed. (Kevin Willis, who grabbed 1,258 boards that same season, came closest. Willis lamented that Rodman had an advantage in winning the rebounding title with his lack of offensive responsibilities.) In a March 1992 game, Rodman grabbed a career-high 34 rebounds. However, the aging Pistons were eliminated by the up-and-coming New York Knicks in the first round of the 1992 playoffs. Rodman experienced a tough loss when coach Chuck Daly, whom he had admired as a surrogate father, resigned in May; Rodman skipped the preseason camp and was fined $68,000. The following 1992–93 season was even more tumultuous. Rodman and Annie Bakes, the mother of his daughter Alexis, were divorcing after a short marriage, an experience which left him traumatized. The Pistons won only 40 games and missed the 1993 playoffs entirely. Four years later in his biography Bad As I Wanna Be, Rodman revealed just how far he had fallen. He had driven to The Palace of Auburn Hills in February 1993 late one night carrying a loaded rifle in his truck, debating whether or not he wanted to continue living. Eventually he fell asleep in the truck, where he was found by police who had been called to perform a welfare check on Rodman by a friend. It was in that moment that he had an epiphany: ""I decided that instead [of killing myself] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn\'t want to go ... So I just said, \'I\'m going to live my life the way I want to live it and be happy doing it.\' At that moment I tamed [sic] my whole life around. I killed the person I didn\'t want to be."" The book was later adapted for a TV movie Bad As I Wanna Be: The Dennis Rodman Story. Although he had three years and $11.8 million remaining on his contract, Rodman demanded a trade. On October 1, 1993, the Pistons dealt him to the San Antonio Spurs. = Playoff upset (1993–1994) In the 1993–94 season, Rodman joined a Spurs team that was built around perennial All-Star center David Robinson, with a supporting cast of forwards Dale Ellis, Willie Anderson and guard Vinny Del Negro. On the hardwood, Rodman now was played as a power forward and won his third straight rebounding title, averaging 17.3 boards per game, along with another All-Defensive Team call-up. Living up to his promise of killing the ""shy imposter"" and ""being himself"" instead, Rodman began to show first signs of unconventional behavior: before the first game, he shaved his hair and dyed it blonde, which was followed up by stints with red, purple, blue hair and a look inspired from the film Demolition Man. During the season, he headbutted Stacey King and John Stockton, refused to leave the hardwood once after being ejected, and had a highly publicized affair with Madonna. The only player to whom Rodman related was reserve center Jack Haley, who earned his trust by not being shocked after a visit to a gay bar. However, despite a 55-win season, Rodman and the Spurs did not survive the first round of the 1994 playoffs and bowed out against the Utah Jazz in four games. Team conflict and shoulder injury (1994–1995) In the following 1994–95 season, Rodman clashed with the Spurs front office. He was suspended for the first three games, took a leave of absence on November 11, and was suspended again on December 7. He finally returned on December 10 after missing 19 games. After joining the team, he suffered a shoulder separation in a motorcycle accident, limiting his season to 49 games. Normally, he would not have qualified for any season records for missing so many games, but by grabbing 823 rebounds, he just surpassed the 800-rebound limit for listing players and won his fourth straight rebounding title by averaging 16.8 boards per game and made the All-NBA Team. The Spurs won 62 games.', 'He would not meet his father again until 2012. Rodman and his two sisters, Debra and Kim, grew up in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas, at the time one of the most impoverished areas of the city. Rodman\'s mother gave him the nickname ""The Worm"" for how he wiggles while playing pinball. Rodman was so attached to his mother that he refused to move when she sent him to a nursery when he was four years old. According to Rodman, his mother was more interested in his two sisters, who were both considered more talented than he was in basketball and made him a laughingstock whenever he tagged along with them. He felt generally ""overwhelmed"" by the all-female household. Debra and Kim would go on to become All-Americans at Louisiana Tech and Stephen F. Austin, respectively. Debra won two national titles with the Lady Techsters. While attending South Oak Cliff High School, Rodman was a gym class student of future Texas A&M basketball coach Gary Blair. Blair coached Rodman\'s sisters Debra and Kim, winning three state championships. However, Rodman was not considered an athletic standout. According to Rodman, he was ""unable to hit a layup"" and was listed in the high school basketball teams but was either benched or cut from the squads. Measuring only 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m) as a freshman in high school, he also failed to make the football teams and was ""totally devastated"". After finishing high school, Rodman worked as an overnight janitor at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. He then experienced a sudden growth spurt from 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m) to 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m) and decided to try basketball again, despite becoming even more withdrawn because he felt odd in his own body. A family friend tipped off the head coach of Cooke County College (now North Central Texas College) in Gainesville, Texas. In his single semester there, he averaged 17.6 points and 13.3 rebounds, before flunking out due to poor academic performance.']","Dennis Rodman believes that most people around the country or the world view him as someone who is trying to be free and express himself.

For the season, Howard was named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time, and was also named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team.

In the first round of the playoffs against the 76ers, Howard recorded 24 points and 24 rebounds in Game 5 to give Orlando a 3–2 lead before the Magic closed out the series in six games. In the second round against the Boston Celtics, after the Magic blew a lead in Game 5 to fall behind 3–2 in the series, Howard publicly stated that he should have been given the ball more and questioned coach Stan Van Gundy\'s tactics. The Magic went on to defeat Boston to win the series and move on to the Eastern Conference Finals. There they, defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–2. Howard had a playoff career-high 40 points to go with his 14 rebounds in the deciding Game 6, leading Orlando to the NBA Finals for the first time in 14 years. In the NBA Finals, the Los Angeles Lakers took the first two home games, before a home win by the Magic brought the deficit to 2–1.

In the 2010–11 season, Howard posted career highs in points and field goal percentage. He became the first player in league history to win Defensive Player of the Year honors for three consecutive seasons. Howard led the league in double-doubles and also averaged 14.1 rebounds, 2.3 blocks and a career-high 1.3 steals this season. He led the Magic to 52 wins, as they finished as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. They went on to lose to the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of 2011 NBA Playoffs. He had a playoff career-high 46 points and 19 rebounds in Orlando\'s 103–93 loss to Atlanta in Game 1. Howard led the NBA in technical fouls with 18 in the regular season, and received one-game suspensions after his 16th and 18th technicals. He also led the NBA in dunks for six consecutive seasons, from 2005-06 to 2010-2011, with a high of 269 dunks in the 2007-2008 season Final season in Orlando (2011–2012) Due to a lockout, the 2011–12 regular season was shortened to 66 games. Not long after the lockout ended, Howard, who was eligible to become a free agent at the end of the season, demanded a trade to the New Jersey Nets, Los Angeles Lakers or Dallas Mavericks. Howard stated that although his preference was to remain in Orlando, he did not feel the Magic organization was doing enough to build a championship contender. He would later meet with Magic officials and agree to back off his trade demands, but stated that he also felt the team needed to make changes to the roster if they wanted to contend for a championship. On January 12, 2012, Howard attempted an NBA regular season record 39 free throws against the Golden State Warriors. Howard entered the game making 42 percent of his free throws for the season and just below 60 percent for his career. The Warriors hacked Howard intentionally throughout the game, and he broke Wilt Chamberlain\'s regular-season record of 34 set in 1962. Howard made 21 of the 39 attempts, finishing with 45 points and 23 rebounds in the Magic\'s 117–109 victory. On January 24, 2012, Howard became the Magic\'s all-time scoring leader. On March 15, 2012, on the day of the trading deadline for the 2011–12 NBA season, Howard waived his right to opt out of his contract at the end of the season and committed to stay with the Magic through the 2012–13 season. He had previously asked to be traded to the New Jersey Nets. Had he not signed the amendment, the Magic were prepared to trade him to avoid losing him as a free agent. On April 5, Van Gundy said that he had been informed by management that Howard wanted him fired. During the interview, the center walked up and hugged his coach, unaware that Van Gundy had confirmed a report that Howard denied. Van Gundy was let go after the season. On April 19, 2012, Howard\'s agent said that Howard would undergo surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back and would miss the rest of the 2011–12 season, as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. During the offseason, Howard again requested a trade to the Nets, who had relocated to Brooklyn. He intended to become a free agent at the end of the 2012–13 season if he was not traded to Brooklyn. = On August 10, 2012, Howard was traded from Orlando to the Los Angeles Lakers in a deal that also involved the Philadelphia 76ers and the Denver Nuggets. Howard took six months off from basketball after his April back surgery, and only had the combined four weeks of training camp and preseason to prepare for the season. Still working himself into shape, Howard paced himself throughout the season on both offense and defense. On January 4, 2013, Howard injured his right shoulder in the second half of the Lakers\' 107–102 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. At the midpoint of the season, the Lakers were a disappointing 17–24. Howard was averaging 17.1 points on 58.2% shooting, 12.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks, but also 3.6 fouls a game with 3.2 turnovers while making only 50.4% of his free throws. Howard was upset that he was not getting the ball enough, and he felt that Kobe Bryant was shooting too much. Moving forward, Howard said he needed to ""bring it"" and dominate in more ways than just scoring. Howard missed games due to his recurring shoulder injury in January and February. In February, Bryant said that Howard ""worries too much"" and ""doesn\'t want to let anyone down"", urging him to play through the pain when Pau Gasol was sidelined with a torn plantar fascia. Howard returned the next game after commenting that Bryant was ""not a doctor, I\'m not a doctor. That\'s his opinion."" During the All-Star break, Howard adopted a healthier diet to get into better shape to anchor the Lakers\' defense and run head coach Mike D\'Antoni\'s preferred pick and rolls. Still, on February 23, Howard said he was ""not even close"" to physically being where he wanted to be. Coach Mike D\'Antoni attributed Howard\'s difficulty running the pick-and-roll—a play the coach had expected would be a staple for the team—with Steve Nash to Howard\'s lack of conditioning. The Lakers were 8–2 after the All-Star break, passing Utah for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference, and Howard averaged 15.5 points, 14.8 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks. In his first game back in Orlando on March 12, Howard scored a season-high 39 points and had 16 rebounds in a 106–97 Lakers win. Booed throughout the game, he made 25 of 39 free throws, setting franchise records for free throws made and attempted while tying his own NBA record for attempts. Howard made 16 of 20 free throws when he was fouled intentionally by the Magic. With Howard anchoring the Lakers defense and his improved overall play, the Lakers made the playoffs, but were swept in the opening round by San Antonio. Howard was ejected in Game 4 with over nine minutes left in the third quarter. Howard finished the season with his lowest scoring average since his second year in the NBA, but he was the league leader in rebounding and ranked second in field goal percentage. Although he was recovering from his back surgery, he only missed six games all season—all due to his torn labrum. Howard was named to the All-NBA Third Team after having received five consecutive first-team honors. He became a free agent in the summer, and he was offered a maximum contract of five years and $118 million by the Lakers. = On July 13, 2013, Howard signed with the Houston Rockets on a four-year, $88 million contract, joining James Harden to form a formidable duo. Howard finished the regular season with averages of 18.3 points and 12.2 rebounds and earned All-NBA Second Team honors. During the 2014 playoffs, Howard averaged 26 points and 13.7 rebounds per game, but the Rockets were eliminated by the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round, losing the series 4–2. After playing in the Rockets\' first 10 out of 11 games to start the 2014–15 season, Howard missed 11 straight due to a strained right knee before returning to action on December 13 against the Denver Nuggets and recording his 10,000th career rebound. However, on January 31, Howard was ruled out for a further month due to persistent trouble with his right knee. After setbacks forced him out for a further month and a total of 26 games, Howard returned to action on March 25 against the New Orleans Pelicans. He started the game but was held under 17 minutes by coach Kevin McHale and finished with just four points and seven rebounds in a 95–93 win. Howard played only 41 games in the regular season. The Rockets clinched their first division title in over 20 years and made it to the Western Conference Finals, where they lost 4–1 to the Golden State Warriors. On November 4, 2015, Howard had 23 points and 14 rebounds against the Orlando Magic. He shot 10-of-10 to become the first Rocket to make 10 or more field goals without a miss since Yao Ming went 12-of-12 in 2009. On December 26, he eclipsed 15,000 points for his career in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. On January 18, 2016, in an overtime loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, Howard had 36 points and tied a career high with 26 rebounds en route to his 10th straight double-double, the league\'s longest active streak at the time, and his longest since a 14-game run in 2012–13. On June 22, 2016, Howard declined his $23 million player option for the 2016–17 season and became an unrestricted free agent. = On July 12, 2016, Howard signed a three-year, $70 million contract with his hometown team the Atlanta Hawks. With the retirement of Tim Duncan, Howard entered the 2016–17 season as the NBA\'s active leader in rebounds (12,089) and blocked shots (1,916). In his debut for the Hawks in their season opener on October 27, Howard grabbed 19 rebounds in a 114–99 win over the Washington Wizards. It was the most rebounds for anyone in their Atlanta debut, breaking the mark of 18 that Shareef Abdur-Rahim set on October 30, 2001. On November 2, he scored a season-high 31 points in a 123–116 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.', 'Howard earned a reputation for his quick feet, ability to grasp fundamentals, and excellent moves in the low post, but also for his 1-to-2 assist-to-turnover ratio and a high number of fouls. = As his sophomore year began, media reports alleged that three Wolverines basketball players were paid $300 each to participate in a charity basketball tournament in mid-1992, during the off-season. The reports further alleged that some others, including Howard, appeared at several summer basketball camps together, which was a possible violation of NCAA rules. At the beginning of his 1992–93 sophomore season, Michigan returned its top nine scorers and began the season ranked number one in the country by the Associated Press. Michigan lost its second game of the season in a rematch with Duke. Howard was described as the steadiest player on the team that season by coach Fisher. During the season, Howard purchased a million-dollar disability insurance policy approved by the NCAA under the Exceptional Student Athlete Disability Insurance Program available to student-athletes who are projected to be chosen high in the NBA, National Football League (NFL), and Major League Baseball drafts. In the semifinals of the 1993 NCAA Division I men\'s basketball tournament against Kentucky, Howard contributed on offense and held Jamal Mashburn in check defensively; Mashburn did not make a field goal in the last 12:36 of regulation. Sportswriter Jay Mariotti wrote that Howard had done ""a terrific defensive job"" in guarding Mashburn. The 31–4 Wolverines were matched up against the 33–4 North Carolina Tar Heels in the championship game; both Fisher and North Carolina head coach Dean Smith were seeking their second national title. During the championship game Howard picked up his second personal foul with 9 minutes 42 seconds remaining in the first half and was soon substituted out as the entire team dealt with an accumulation of fouls. The game would be remembered for a late technical foul against Webber for attempting to call a time out when the Wolverines had none left; this led to a Tar Heels victory. Over the course of the season, Howard averaged 14.6 points and 7.4 rebounds. After the season, Webber and Howard were invited to try out for the United States national basketball team that would compete at the 1993 World University Games and Under-22 World Championships. Howard did not make the team. = With Webber\'s departure for the NBA after his sophomore season, the 1993–94 Wolverines team entered the season ranked fifth in the nation as it opened the season against number 13 Georgia Tech. Since his grandmother had been born on December 25, Howard got a tattoo reading ""Jannie Mae"" over his heart during Christmas break. During the season, Howard contracted the chicken pox in January. Michigan had a 21–6 (13–4 Big Ten) record and tied with the Purdue Boilermakers for the conference lead with one game remaining. Michigan then lost (for the third time in its last four games) to a struggling Northwestern Wildcats team, and finished second in the Big Ten. After the season, Howard was selected as a first team All-Big-Ten member along with his teammate Rose, Purdue\'s Robinson, Michigan State\'s Shawn Respert, and Indiana\'s Damon Bailey. In the opening round of the 1994 NCAA Division I men\'s basketball tournament, Howard helped Michigan to a 78–74 overtime victory over Pepperdine by scoring 28 points and adding 9 rebounds before fouling out. In the second round, Howard posted 34 points and 18 rebounds to lead the team to an 84–79 victory over Texas. Michigan faced a Joe Smith-led Maryland in the Sweet Sixteen round. Howard scored 24 points and had 11 rebounds before fouling out with 2:49 remaining in the 78–71 victory. Howard earned the regional MVP award with a game-high 30 points and 13 rebounds in the Elite Eight round, despite collecting two fouls in the first two minutes and losing against the Arkansas Razorbacks, which had United States President Bill Clinton in attendance as a vocal supporter. On April 18, Howard announced his intention to enter the 1994 NBA draft.', ""Armstrong. Ewing came to set a screen for Starks, who faked to the left, as if to exploit the screen, but then drove along the baseline and, with his left hand, dunked over Horace Grant and Michael Jordan. One of the low points of Starks' career came in the 1994 NBA Finals against the Houston Rockets. In the closing seconds of Game 3 and the Knicks trailing by three, Starks was fouled by Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon while attempting a three-pointer. At the time, the NBA allowed only two free throws during a foul on a three-pointer. Starks made both, but Houston won 93–89 (the league would change the rule to allow three free throws the next season). Starks and the Knicks then watched their home court host the New York Rangers' first Stanley Cup celebration in 54 years, with their 3–2 win over the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. It served as an inspiration for the Knicks to recover to take a 3–2 series lead going into Game 6."", 'Tim Duncan remarked in 2007, ""[Howard] is so developed... He has so much promise and I am glad that I will be out of the league when he is peaking."" Kevin Garnett echoed those sentiments: ""[Howard] is a freak of nature, man... I was nowhere near that physically talented. I wasn\'t that gifted, as far as body and physical presence."" After a game in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Philadelphia 76ers swingman Andre Iguodala said: ""It\'s like he can guard two guys at once. He can guard his guy and the guy coming off the pick-and-roll, which is almost impossible to do... If he gets any more athletic or jumps any higher, they\'re going to have to change the rules."" In December 2007, ESPN writer David Thorpe declared Howard the most dominant center in the NBA. Early in his career, many sports pundits rated Howard one of the top young prospects in the NBA. Howard has a reputation as a negative locker room presence. In a 2013 interview, he called his former Orlando Magic teammates a ""team full of people no one wanted"". In a 2013 article entitled ""Is Dwight Howard the NBA\'s Worst Teammate?"", Bleacher Report asserted that Howard had ""extinguished all bridges with the franchise where he spent his first eight NBA seasons"". Howard did not get along with Kobe Bryant when he first played for the Lakers and did not get along with James Harden when he played for the Rockets. During a 2015 game when he was a member of the Rockets, Howard was caught on video grabbing the genitals of teammate Isaiah Canaan. When he was traded from the Atlanta Hawks to the Charlotte Hornets, some of his Hawks teammates reportedly cheered. After Charlotte traded Howard to the Washington Wizards, commentator Brendan Haywood asserted that Howard was ""\'hard to deal with, doesn\'t accept responsibility, cries a lot, has bad tendencies\'"", and has ""\'awful body language\'"", and added that his teammates were ""\'sick and tired of his act\'"". In 2018, NBC News reported that ""Howard’s time with the Magic, Lakers and Rockets devolved into interpersonal strife well before he left those teams"". Also in 2018, The Ringer published a piece titled ""Everybody (Still) Hates Dwight"" in which it called Howard ""almost certainly the least popular player in the NBA"". When the Lakers signed Howard in 2019, the team reportedly warned Howard that he would be dismissed if he engaged in any ""tomfoolery or shenanigans"". = = Howard appeared as a special guest on an episode of the ABC series Extreme Makeover: Home Edition that aired April 2, 2006, in which Ty Pennington and his team built a new home and ministry offices for Sadie Holmes, who operates a social services ministry in the Orlando area. Howard competed in season 6 of The Masked Singer as ""Octopus"".', 'Eventually, the Lakers cut the lead to 99–97 with 11.8 seconds to play. On the final possession, after Kobe and Shaq missed consecutive layups, Sacramento center Vlade Divac knocked the ball away from the basket in an attempt to run out the clock. However, the ball bounced right to Horry, who hit a three-pointer as time expired to win Game 4 100–99. A day later, Magic Johnson called Horry ""one of the 10 best clutch players in league history"". The Lakers would win the series in 7 games and sweep the New Jersey Nets 4–0 in the NBA Finals to complete a three-peat. Horry started all four games in the Finals. On March 5, 2003, Indiana Pacers center Jermaine O\'Neal swatted the inside pass for Shaquille O\'Neal to a wide-open Horry, who hit the game-winning shot. In the 2003 playoffs, the Lakers were attempting to win their fourth straight NBA championship. In the closing seconds of Game 5 of the Western Conference Semifinals, Horry\'s potential game-winning shot rattled in and out, putting a halt to the Lakers\' rally from a 25-point deficit. The Lakers were eliminated in six games. Horry was 0-18 from the three-point line during the series. = Following the 2002–03 season, Horry became a free agent. Citing concerns over family, all of whom live in Houston, he signed with the San Antonio Spurs. During the 2002–03 season, the Lakers had increased Horry\'s minutes to nearly 30 a game. With the Spurs, coach Gregg Popovich cut his minutes significantly. In the 2003–04 season, the Spurs won 57 games and reached the 2004 playoffs where they swept the Memphis Grizzlies in four games, before losing in six games to the Los Angeles Lakers. During the following season, the Spurs reached the 2005 playoffs. Horry went 38 of 85 from three-point range. In Game 5 of the 2005 NBA Finals, after only scoring three points in the first three quarters, he scored 21 of the Spurs\' points in the fourth quarter and overtime. The Spurs went on to win Game 5, 96–95, after Horry hit a game-winning three-point shot with 5.9 seconds left. ESPN columnist Bill Simmons wrote, ""Horry\'s Game 5 ranks alongside MJ\'s Game 6 in 1998, Worthy\'s Game 7 in 1988, Frazier\'s Game 7 in 1970, and every other clutch Finals performance over the years"". His 15 three point shots was a finals record that stood until the 2019 NBA Finals when Fred VanVleet made 16. During the 2007 playoffs, Horry body-checked Phoenix Suns\' point guard Steve Nash, drawing a flagrant foul call. During the ensuing commotion, Raja Bell was assessed a technical foul for charging at him. Horry was ejected from the game and suspended for Games 5 and 6. Amar\'e Stoudemire and Boris Diaw, who left the bench, were suspended for Game 5. The Spurs won the two ensuing games and moved on to the 2007 NBA Finals, where they swept the Cleveland Cavaliers. Horry began wearing the number 25 again after the 2006–07 season. After the 2007–08 season, Horry became a free agent but went unsigned, marking his last professional season. As of 2025, Horry works as a commentator for the Lakers on Spectrum SportsNet. = Horry is one of four NBA players to win championships with three teams: two with the Houston Rockets, three with the Los Angeles Lakers, and two with the San Antonio Spurs. He holds NBA records for most steals in a Finals game and for most three-point shots made in a playoff game without a miss. He is the only non-member of the 1950s and 1960s Boston Celtics to win more than six championships. When he retired, Horry held the record for three-pointers all-time in the NBA Finals with 56, having eclipsed Michael Jordan\'s record of 42. Five players passed him before the 2023 NBA Finals. He holds the NBA playoffs record for most three-point field goals made in a game without a miss (seven) against the Utah Jazz in Game 2 of the 1997 Western Conference Semifinals. In 2009, Horry played in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge against the Philippine Basketball Association All-Stars at Araneta Coliseum in Manila. Horry was the first player to accumulate 100 steals, 100 blocked shots, and 100 threes in one season (steals and blocks were not recorded until the 1973–74 season and the three-point line was not implemented until the 1979–80 season). In 2010, he was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. Horry has played in three Game 7s which went to overtime; the 1993 Western Conference Semifinals, as a member of the Houston Rockets, the 2002 Western Conference Finals with the Los Angeles Lakers, and the 2006 Western Conference Semifinals with the San Antonio Spurs. May 22, 1993, Western Conference Semifinals, Game 7, Houston Rockets at Seattle SuperSonics. With the score tied at 91 late in the fourth quarter and the shot clock winding down, the rookie Horry took a pass from teammate Hakeem Olajuwon and knocked down a midrange jumper to give the Rockets a two-point lead with 32.7 seconds remaining in regulation. However, Horry\'s heroics were not enough to secure the victory for the Rockets, who succumbed to the Sonics 100–103 in overtime. May 22, 1995, Western Conference Finals, Game 1, Houston Rockets at San Antonio Spurs. Horry hit a jumper with 6.5 seconds left to give Houston a 94–93 win over San Antonio. June 11, 1995, NBA Finals, Game 3, Orlando Magic at Houston Rockets. With the Rockets up 101–100 with 20 seconds left and the shot clock winding down, Hakeem Olajuwon kicked it out to Horry, who hit a 3 over Orlando\'s Horace Grant to give Houston a 104–100 lead with 14.1 seconds left. It led them to a 106–103 win and a 3–0 series lead. Houston also won Game 4, 113–101, to complete the sweep and win back-to-back NBA titles. June 10, 2001, NBA Finals, Game 3, Los Angeles Lakers at Philadelphia 76ers. With the series tied at 1, the Sixers were down 89–88 with under a minute left after a three-point play by Kevin Ollie. Brian Shaw found Horry wide open in the corner; he then hit a three-pointer with 47.1 seconds left to give the Lakers a 92–88 lead. Horry, who had been a 44% free throw shooter in the playoffs to that point, also made 4 free throws in the final minute to seal a 96–91 victory. The Sixers never recovered. April 28, 2002, Western Conference First Round, Game 3, Los Angeles Lakers at Portland Trail Blazers. Down 91–89 with 10.2 seconds remaining, Kobe Bryant drove on Ruben Patterson and kicked it out to Horry, who hit the game-winning 3 with 2.1 seconds left. May 26, 2002, Western Conference Finals, Game 4, Sacramento Kings at Los Angeles Lakers.', 'Stephen Jackson made an impression as a first-year player having come from the CBA and foreign leagues that year but was not retained. Years later, Jackson called Scott the ""worst communicator for young guys"". However, the team would improve in dividends in the 2001–02 season with the arrival of Jason Kidd in a trade that sent Stephon Marbury to the Phoenix Suns. Kidd and the Nets won 52 games, a franchise record. In the process, they won their first Atlantic Division crown and were the number one seed. In the first round against the Indiana Pacers, the Nets had to play the full five games to narrowly avoid an upset, which saw them go on a 13-2 barrage in the second overtime to win their first playoff series since 1984. In the semifinals against Charlotte, they dispatched them in five games to advance to their first Conference Finals as an NBA team and first overall semifinal since the ABA era in 1976. They faced the Boston Celtics in the Conference Finals and split the first four games, which notably saw them blow a 26-point lead in Game 3. The Nets rallied with decisive victories in Game 5 and 6 to win the series. They appeared in their first NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, who were headlined by Shaquille O\'Neal and Kobe Bryant in their third straight NBA Finals appearance. In Game 1, Kidd had the first triple-double in an NBA Finals since 1993, but the Lakers led by a score of 42–19 only six minutes into the second quarter and never looked back in a 99–94 win. In Game 2, the Nets were down six by the first quarter being over and never cut into the lead after that on the road to a 23-point loss. Game 3 was the only tight game that saw the Nets lead until Robert Horry made a three-point shot with 3:04 to go that gave the Lakers a go-ahead lead they never lost. The Nets lost Game 4 by a score of 113–107 as the Lakers won their third straight championship. The following campaign saw them regress to 49 wins, marred by injuries to newly acquired Dikembe Mutombo that saw Kidd as their lone All-Star. They were 34–15 at the All-Star break, but they played below .500 the rest of the year to wind up with 49 wins, which was one short of the Detroit Pistons for the number one seed in the East. In the First Round against the Milwaukee Bucks, they split the first four games before eventually pulling out a series win in Game 6. They did not lose again for the next two rounds, dispatching Boston in the Semifinals and the Pistons in a straight sweep to win their second straight conference championship. They were matched in the NBA Finals to face the 60-win San Antonio Spurs, headlined by two-time league MVP Tim Duncan, a retiring David Robinson, and future stars Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker. The two teams split the first four games. The Spurs won Game 1 after a 32-17 third quarter to ultimately win by 12, but New Jersey won Game 2 after a ten-point fourth quarter lead nearly turned into a loss before a missed three point shot with seconds remaining meant the Nets held on to win 87–85. In Game 3, the Spurs trailed by three before the fourth quarter started but took the lead with eight minutes remaining and never relinquished it. Game 4 saw the Nets lead by eleven points in a tight defensive affair that saw both teams score under 80 points for the only time in the series. The Spurs were up by one in the fourth quarter after a busy third quarter, but Kidd made four free throws in the final nine seconds as the Nets won 77–76 to tie the series. In Game 5, the Spurs took control early and led for a majority of the game, and after making a shot in the third quarter with three minutes remaining to take the lead back, they never looked back in a 93–83 win. Game 6 saw the Nets on the brink of elimination. The Nets took the lead on the first points and even had a 10-point barrage at one point, but they were only up three points at halftime. By the end of the third, they were up 63-57 and had not trailed once. The Nets led 72–63 with 8:55 left to play in the fourth quarter. However, the Nets went cold in an instant, losing the lead through the help of Duncan and newly acquired Stephen Jackson to score ten points in the span of two minutes. The Nets scored just five points in the last 8:55 of the game while the Spurs ended up with 25 in that same span as the Nets allowed 19 unanswered points, complete with Duncan nearly having a quadruple-double (21 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists, 8 blocks) while a retiring Robinson had 13 points and 17 rebounds. The Nets scored 492 total points in the series, the second lowest for a six-game series while shooting 34.5%. Kidd was quoted as saying that the team lost their composure and ""unraveled"". By July 2003, tension was apparent with the Nets, who were being dogged by reports that Kidd asked that Scott to be fired in order for him to agree to re-sign to a six-year contract. Scott himself admitted that his stubborn qualities with Kidd requires him to need to try to be more of a ""taskmaster"" in being more hands on, particularly with the departure of assistant coach Eddie Jordan, who had left for the Washington Wizards after having done his share of calling plays. Scott was approaching the 2003–04 season as the last one of his contract while being dogged by articles that had anonymous sources criticizing his coaching in the 2003 NBA Finals. Scott was fired during the 2003–04 season, as New Jersey had a disappointing 22–20 record coming into the All-Star break, even though they were leading their division at the time of his dismissal. Rumors of a rift between Scott and Kidd circulated media outlets, with sources allegedly claiming that Kidd wanted Scott out of Jersey. All the parties, including Rod Thorn, denied the reports. Scott claimed that he was ""very surprised"" by the report and that he and Kidd ""always got along"". Kidd stated later that ""Sometimes change or a different voice is good."" He was succeeded by his assistant Lawrence Frank. While coaching the Nets, Scott lived in Livingston, New Jersey. = Scott became the head coach of the New Orleans Hornets in 2004. Chris Paul was drafted by the team in 2005, and was named Rookie of the Year. In the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons, he guided the team to a pair of sub .500 seasons.', 'He made his first basket with a three-pointer in a 138–136 overtime loss to the Phoenix Suns on 16 March.', 'Miles. On August 24, 2019, Howard was waived by the Grizzlies. = On August 26, 2019, Howard signed a $2.6 million veteran\'s minimum contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, reuniting him with his former team. He was replacing DeMarcus Cousins, a free agent signed earlier in the offseason who was lost for the year after suffering a knee injury. To assure the team that he would accept any role the team asked, Howard offered to sign a non-guaranteed contract, freeing the Lakers to cut him at any time. During the season, the Lakers split time fairly evenly between him and starting center JaVale McGee. On January 13, 2020, Howard scored a season-high 21 points on a 9-of-11 shooting and got a season-high 15 rebounds. In Game 4 of the Western Conference finals against the Denver Nuggets, Lakers coach Frank Vogel started Howard to match up against the Nuggets\' Nikola Jokić. Howard had 12 points and 11 rebounds in 23 minutes to help the Lakers win and take a 3–1 lead in the series. He had started twice during the regular season, but this was his first start by coach\'s decision when McGee was available. The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals, winning the series 4–2 over the Miami Heat and giving Howard his first NBA championship. = On November 21, 2020, the Philadelphia 76ers signed Howard to a one-year deal worth $2,564,753. With the 76ers he averaged 7 points and 8.4 rebounds. Howard played 69 games with the Sixers with six starts in 17.3 minutes. He was suspended for one game after getting into a scuffle with Udonis Haslem where both were assessed technical fouls and Haslem was ejected. Howard was suspended because he incurred his 16th technical foul of the year. Despite winning the Atlantic division and the Eastern Conference regular season, in the Conference Semifinals against the Atlanta Hawks, the 76ers would lose in seven games which included a squandered 26-point lead in Game 5. = Howard signed a $2.6 million veteran\'s minimum contract with the Los Angeles Lakers on August 6, 2021. He averaged 6.2 points and 5.9 rebounds playing 60 games, starting 27 for the injury-ridden Anthony Davis. Despite one of the strongest rosters in the league, the Lakers, viewed by many as the premier championship contender, failed to make the playoffs, which was widely regarded by experts to be one of the greatest underachievements in NBA history. = Unable to secure a roster spot in the NBA, Howard signed with the Taoyuan Leopards of the T1 League in Taiwan on November 7, 2022. While the league usually caps the salary of foreign players to US$200,000, it approved an exception for Howard, who would receive over $1 million. The league argued that Howard would raise the level of competition and boost the audience\'s interest. On November 19, Howard made his Leopards debut, putting up 38 points, 25 rebounds, 9 assists, and 4 blocks in a 120–115 win over New Taipei CTBC DEA. However, just one day later, after playing his first two games back-to-back and nearly averaging a triple-double, Howard was sidelined with a knee injury until mid-December. Howard attributed this to playing over 90 minutes within 26 hours, which he was no longer used to. His knee injury resurfaced after playing another string of back-to-back games from December 16 to 17, causing him to sit out another two weeks and it was decided that in the future, Howard would mostly be used in home games to not further aggravate the injury. In February 2023, Howard was named an All-Star for the T1 League as well as the All-Star Game Most Famous Player, and was also selected to participate in the Three-Point Contest. He scored 37 points and was named All-Star game MVP. He was the league\'s rebounds leader for the 2022–23 season. On May 10, 2023, Howard was selected to the T1 League All-Defensive First Team in 2022–23 season. The next day, Howard was selected to the all-T1 League first team, and was awarded the Most Valuable Import of the T1 League for the 2022–23 season a day after that. = After the end of the season, Howard reportedly had talks about joining the Australian National Basketball League and expressed openness to play in the Philippine Basketball Association, but joined neither. On March 1, 2024, Howard briefly signed with the Mets de Guaynabo of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional, but never played for them. Howard briefly played on several exhibition teams. He joined Strong Group for the Dubai International Basketball Championship in January 2024, where he helped secure a silver medal finish and on May 30, 2024, he joined the Taiwan Mustangs of The Asian Tournament (TAT). In 2025, Howard was chosen to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as an individual player and also as a member of the 2008 United States men\'s Olympic basketball team. On March 5, 2006, Howard was named to the 2006–2008 USA Basketball Men\'s Senior National Team program. As the team\'s regular starting center, he helped lead the team to a 5–0 record during its pre-World Championship tour, and subsequently helped the team win the bronze medal at the 2006 FIBA World Championship. During the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, Howard was on the team which won its first nine games en route to qualifying for the finals and a spot for the 2008 Olympics. He started in eight of those nine games, averaging 8.9 ppg, 5.3 rpg and led the team in shooting .778 from the field. In the finals, he made all seven of his shots and scored 20 points as the USA defeated Argentina to win the gold medal. On June 23, 2008, Howard was named as one of the members of the 12-man squad representing the United States in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. With Howard starting as center, Team USA won all of its games en route to the gold medal, restarting a streak of gold medals interrupted at the 2004 Olympics. Howard averaged 10.9 points and 5.8 rebounds per game in the tournament. Standing 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 m) and weighing 265 pounds (120 kg), Howard plays the center position. He led the NBA in rebounding from 2007 to 2010, and again from 2012 to 2013. Howard\'s rebounding was in part facilitated by his extraordinary athleticism; his running vertical leap was tested at 39.5 inches (100 cm) in 2011, rare for a player of his size. He demonstrated this skill in the 2007 Slam Dunk Contest, where he completed an alley oop dunk from teammate Jameer Nelson while slapping a sticker onto the backboard at 12 ft 6 in (3.81 m) high. The sticker showed an image of his own smiling face with a handwritten ""All things through Christ Phil: 4:13"", a paraphrase of Philippians 4:13. Howard\'s abilities and powerful physique have drawn attention from fellow NBA All-Stars.', ""However, in the final seconds of Game 6, Olajuwon blocked Starks' last-second three-point attempt to give Houston an 86–84 victory. In Game 7, Starks had one of the worst games of his career, shooting 2-for-18 from the field, including 1-for-10 in the fourth quarter. The Rockets went on to win the game and the championship. In 1995, Starks became the first player to hit 200 three-pointers in a single season. In the offseason, Pat Riley left the Knicks to go to the Miami Heat after a dispute with then General Manager Dave Checketts. The Knicks hired Don Nelson, bringing back the tensions from Starks' first season in Golden State. Nelson started Hubert Davis over Starks. Nelson was eventually fired mid-season, and the Knicks replaced him with Jeff Van Gundy. In 1996, Allan Houston took Starks' starting spot. Starks was a steady contributor off the bench and won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award in 1997. On February 18, 1997, Starks hit a buzzer-beating three-pointer to defeat the Phoenix Suns at home, 95–94. On the play, he rebounded an Allan Houston missed three while getting to the three-point line and head-faked the Suns' Wesley Person before releasing the shot just as the horn sounded. Replays were inconclusive as to whether the shot was released in time, but the basket stood. This may have been the most dramatic regular season moment of Starks' career, as it was his only buzzer beater to win an NBA game. = In January 1999, Starks was traded back to his original team, the Golden State Warriors, along with Chris Mills and Terry Cummings, in exchange for Latrell Sprewell. Starks remained with the Warriors until February 2000, when he was traded to the Chicago Bulls as part of a three-team trade that sent Billy Owens and Larry Hughes to the Warriors. = Starks played for the Chicago Bulls for four games in the 1999–2000 season. When the Bulls were unable to trade him before the February trade deadline, both sides contacted the league and inquired whether Starks could be released without pay so he could join a contender. The matter went to arbitrator who ruled that Starks could be released without pay, but would not be eligible for the playoffs with another team. With the ruling, Starks rescinded his request to be released but the Bulls released him anyway, citing their desire to focus on the younger core of the team. = Starks finished his career with the Utah Jazz, playing for the franchise from 2000 to 2002. After his stint with Golden State, Starks played for the Chicago Bulls and Utah Jazz before failing to make an NBA team in 2002 and retiring with 10,829 career points. He currently works for the Knicks as an alumnus and fan development official, and as a pre-and-post-game analyst on MSG Network's home Knicks game coverage."", 'Men\'s Olympic Basketball Teams. In 1996, Payton and the SuperSonics, under coach George Karl, reached the NBA Finals after winning a franchise record 64 games and lost in six games to Michael Jordan\'s Chicago Bulls. In 2001, the SuperSonics were bought by Howard Schultz, with whom Payton had a sour relationship. When Payton did not attend the first day of training camp in 2002, Schultz insisted that Payton be traded. = In the middle of the 2002–03 season at the trade deadline, Payton was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks along with Desmond Mason in exchange for Ray Allen, Kevin Ollie, Ronald Murray and 2003 first-round draft pick. Payton played the remaining 28 games with the Bucks, averaging 19.6 points and 7.4 assists per game. The Bucks faced the defending Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Nets in the first round of the playoffs, pushing the Nets to six games before losing to the more experienced and well rounded Nets. Payton led the Bucks in scoring (18.5) and assists (8.7) during the series, which included a 20-point, 14-assist performance in a Game 4 Milwaukee win. = As an unrestricted free agent prior to the 2003–04 season, Payton, along with Karl Malone, signed with the Los Angeles Lakers to make a run at their first NBA Championship. Payton started in all 82 games and averaged 14.6 points with 5.5 assists and 1.2 steals, but struggled with Lakers coach Phil Jackson\'s triangle offense, which limited his ball-handling and post-up opportunities. Payton provided offense in games where superstar teammates Shaquille O\'Neal or Kobe Bryant could not play due to injury, including a 30-point outburst in an overtime win against the Cleveland Cavaliers on February 4. Despite injuries to Malone, O\'Neal and Bryant throughout the season, the Lakers won 56 games and the Pacific Division. In the playoffs, Payton averaged just 7.8 points per game, but scored 15 points in Games 3 and 6 of the Lakers\' semifinals series against the San Antonio Spurs, and scored 18 points to go with nine assists in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Lakers would reach the NBA Finals before falling to the Detroit Pistons in five games. = Prior to the 2004–05 season, the Lakers traded Payton and Rick Fox to the Boston Celtics for center Chris Mihm, small forward Jumaine Jones and point guard Chucky Atkins. While Payton expressed displeasure with the trade, he ultimately did report to Boston and began the 2004–05 season as the Celtics\' starting point guard. On February 24, 2005, Payton was traded to the Atlanta Hawks in a deal that brought former Celtic Antoine Walker back to Boston. The Hawks then waived Payton immediately following the trade, and he returned a week later to Boston as a free agent. Payton started all 77 games he played for Boston and averaged 11.3 points per game and 6.1 assists as the Celtics won the Atlantic Division before losing in the first round to the Indiana Pacers. = On September 22, 2005, he signed a one-year $1.1 million contract with Miami, reuniting with Walker (who was acquired seven weeks earlier by the Heat), as well as former Lakers\' teammate Shaquille O\'Neal. Serving as a backup to Jason Williams, Payton averaged 7.7 points and started 25 of 81 games. In the playoffs, Payton did not start but averaged 24.3 minutes a game after averaging 28.5 minutes during the regular season, often playing during pressure situations in the 4th quarter of games. In Game 4 of the semifinals against the New Jersey Nets, Payton hit a critical three-pointer with 56 seconds left in the game to clinch the Heat victory. In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals on the road against the Detroit Pistons, Payton scored 14 points on 6-of-8 shooting, helping the Heat set the tone in the series. Miami won the series in 6 games to reach the team\'s first ever Finals against the Dallas Mavericks. Miami lost the first two games in Dallas and trailed in the final quarter of Game 3 before a comeback led by Dwyane Wade culminated with a Jason Williams pass to Payton, who faked his defender and hit the game-winning jump shot to keep Miami from falling 3–0 in the series. In Game 5, Payton scored 8 points, including Miami\'s final field goal with 29 seconds left, to help clinch a one-point victory. The Heat returned to Dallas for Game 6 and won 95–92, securing their first and Payton\'s only NBA title. On September 6, 2006, the 38-year-old Payton re-signed with the defending champion Miami Heat on a one-year, $1.2 million contract. During the subsequent 2006–07 NBA season, Payton continued to climb up several NBA all-time lists: he moved from 17th to 8th in all-time NBA games played, passed John Havlicek and Robert Parish to move into 7th in all-time minutes played, and passed Hal Greer and Larry Bird to become the 21st-highest scorer in NBA history. = Payton is well known for his trash-talk. He received the fourth-most technical fouls of all time (behind Karl Malone, Charles Barkley, and Rasheed Wallace) with 250. Of his trash talking, Payton has stated ""I never take it too far...I just try to talk and get their mind off the game, and turn their attention on me"", adding that ""sometimes I get accused of trash talking even though I\'m not...[referees and spectators] immediately figure you\'re trash talking. But I could be talking to a guy about what\'s going on or asking about his family."" In addition, All-Star point guard Jason Kidd has referred to Payton as a ""mentor"" for the way he treated Kidd growing up in the same neighborhood of Oakland. In 2001, he gave a humorous, televised ""motivational speech"" to his team during the NBA All-Star Game. = Payton\'s nickname of ""The Glove"" in reference to his defensive skills was popularized during the 1993 Western Conference Finals series against Phoenix. Since Payton\'s career ended in 2007, he has been mentioned among the all-time greatest point guards. Gail Goodrich, who played with Hall of Fame guard Jerry West, said ""Gary Payton is probably as complete a guard as there ever was."" Kevin Johnson considers Payton ""certainly...amongst the best ever"" and ""just as intimidating...maybe even more so than all-time greats Magic Johnson, Isiah Thomas, Tiny Archibald, and Maurice Cheeks."" When asked to classify the best players in each position of the late 1990s and early 21st century, NBA coach George Karl said of Payton, ""I don\'t know who else you\'d take at point guard. Some say Jason Kidd. Well, every time Gary went nose-to-nose with Kidd, Gary won that matchup."" Payton is ranked 35th all-time in points scored, and 11th in assists, but he is most widely recognized for his defensive contributions. The Sporting News said in 2000 that Payton was ""building a case as the best two-way point guard in history"", and asked ""If you weigh offense and defense equally, is Payton the best ever?"" When comparing Payton to the all-time greats, it has been said that ""Payton arguably is the best defender of them all, and his offensive game is better than most."" His defensive prowess was once described by Kevin Johnson:""You think of guys with great hands, like Maurice Cheeks and Derek Harper. Gary is like that.', 'He correctly predicted a win in Game 7 of the second round against the defending champion Boston Celtics. Later in the playoffs, Ewing saw Magic captain Dwight Howard set a new NBA Finals record for most blocked shots in a single Finals game, with nine in Game 4, surpassing the previous record of eight by Ewing himself in Game 5 of the 1994 Finals. In 2010, Ewing finally got the opportunity to coach his son Patrick Ewing Jr.', ""He was named as a replacement after Indiana Pacers forward–center Jermaine O'Neal was injured. He also participated in the Three-point Shootout, where he placed second, after Dirk Nowitzki. The Washington Wizards finished 42–40 and earned the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. During the off-season, Arenas said that he was willing to take a pay cut in order to give the Wizards additional money with which to sign available free agents. He had expressed a desire to win a championship with the Wizards. One of Arenas' most memorable plays was a 40-foot jump shot in Round 1 of the 2006 NBA playoffs in which the Wizards were eliminated by the LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers in six games. 2006–07 season Arenas himself has noted that he withdrew from the United States national team for the 2006 FIBA World Championship because he felt that assistant coaches Mike D'Antoni and Nate McMillan had determined the roster even prior to tryouts. Afterward, he stated that he planned on averaging 50 points against their respective teams (Phoenix Suns and Portland Trail Blazers). He succeeded at his goal versus powerhouse Phoenix, scoring 54 points, including 21-of-37 from the field, 6-of-12 three-pointers (while reportedly eyeing in the direction of Suns chairman Jerry Colangelo), in a high-scoring 144–139 Wizards win over the Suns. However, on February 11 versus the Blazers, he was held to a lowly nine points, including tying the Wizards' franchise record for three-point futility, going 0-for-8 from behind the arc, in a 94–73 loss versus Portland. In an overtime game versus the Los Angeles Lakers on December 17, 2006, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Arenas scored a career-high 60 points, adding 8 rebounds and 8 assists in helping lead the Wizards over the Lakers, 147–141. Arenas holds the Wizards' franchise record for points scored in a game by an individual, a record he now shares with Bradley Beal. The previous record of 56 points was held by Earl Monroe, achieved in 1968, which was also an overtime game against the Lakers. Arenas' 16 points in the extra period also set an NBA record for most points in one overtime period, surpassing Earl Boykins' record by one point. On January 3, 2007, Arenas hit a 32-foot buzzer-beater to win the game against the Milwaukee Bucks, 108–105. Two weeks later on Martin Luther King Jr. Day he hit another buzzer-beating three-pointer to beat the Utah Jazz, 114–111, in a thriller at the Verizon Center. This same scenario has been added as a cut scene in the video game NBA Live 2008."", 'He played 10 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), predominantly with the Dallas Mavericks. Howard was born to Kevin Robinson and Nancy Henderson.

Howard attended Glenn High School in Kernersville, North Carolina, where he was a First-Team All-State selection in his senior year and averaged six blocks per game while shooting 70%. He also averaged a double-double during his junior and senior years, during which time he also received the Frank Spencer Award (for the top player in Northwest North Carolina) twice. During his senior year Howard was handcuffed outside of a BP gas station the night before his SAT examination. Howard had been loitering on the premises with some of his friends, and undercover cops, believing the teenagers had been selling drugs, detained them. In order to get into Wake Forest University Howard needed an SAT score of at least 950. He did not get a 950, saying his score was ""somewhere in the 500s"". In lieu, he spent a year at Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia, where he averaged a double-double, with 19.9 points and 10.1 rebounds per game. Howard led Hargrave to a 27–3 record, shooting well on the floor with 56%. He also averaged 44% from behind the three-point line and 85% from the free throw line. Howard participated in the ACC–SEC game between new signings from the two conferences. Howard scored 14 points in 15 minutes to help lift the ACC team to a 145–115 win over the SEC.

Later in his high school career, he played on the same AAU team as future 76ers' teammate, Nerlens Noel. Carter-Williams had a subdued freshman season at Syracuse in 2011–12 as he played behind Scoop Jardine, Brandon Triche and Dion Waiters. The season began about how Carter-Williams envisioned with him coming off the bench but solidly in Jim Boeheim's rotation. That niche role gradually eroded, however, as Jardine and Triche solidified their starting roles and Waiters emerged as the best sixth man in the nation. It was a difficult first season for him in which he did not play in games and received sporadic minutes in others."", ""1 seed Michigan, as UCLA advanced to their first Final Four since 2008.

Though the scandal dissuaded other potential high school prospects from attending Kansas, Jordan nonetheless decided to take a chance with the school after he was impressed by the university's friendly and personal atmosphere. In the 1989–90 season, freshman Jordan came off the bench to back up starting Jayhawks point guard Kevin Pritchard. Together they helped lead Kansas to a surprising record of 30–5 under second-year coach Roy Williams. With Pritchard's graduation, Jordan became the starting point guard for the 1990–91 season, leading the 27–8 Kansas Jayhawks to the Final Four during his sophomore year. Jordan averaged 12.5 points and recorded 151 assists that season while the team managed three upset victories in the 1991 NCAA Tournament against Indiana (Sweet Sixteen), the Southeast Regional number one seed Arkansas (Elite Eight) and Eastern Regional number one seed North Carolina (National Semifinals) before finishing as National Runner-up to Duke in the National Championship game. Two years later, senior Jordan and teammate Rex Walters helped lead the Jayhawks to further success when they captured the 1993 Big Eight Regular Season Championship and the second seed in the Midwest Region of the 1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament with a 25–6 record. Jordan and Walters' stellar backcourt performance earned them a reputation as one of the NCAA's best guard combinations. Kansas marched through the NCAA tournament, beating Midwest Region number one seed Indiana in the Regional Final to advance to the Final Four for the second time in three years. Though Kansas eventually finished at 29–7 with a loss to North Carolina in the Final Four, the team's outstanding performance that year earned the squad a top ten nationwide ranking during the regular season, including a brief time spent at number one. Jordan's legacy with Kansas is also recognized in holding the Jayhawks' number six spot for most assists in the school's history and is 22nd on the school's all-time scoring list. Jordan was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1993 NBA draft after a storied basketball career at Kansas. Seattle ended up cutting the rookie at the start of the 1993–94 NBA season but Jordan reemerged in the league after being picked up by the Denver Nuggets later in the month on a 10-day contract. He appeared in six games with Denver before being waived again but finished the season in the CBA with the Rochester Renegades and the Sioux Falls Skyforce. The former Jayhawk headed to Australia in what would become the start of a series of overseas stints. His first stop landed him with the Australian National Basketball League's South East Melbourne Magic, where he led the team to an impressive record in 1994. After playing one season in Israel, Jordan headed to Venezuela where he joined the Cocodrilos de Caracas of the Liga Profesional de Baloncesto. With five years of overseas experience, the globetrotter returned to the States and signed two 10-day contracts with the Milwaukee Bucks in early 1999. He donned a Bucks uniform in four games before ultimately being released in March. Jordan returned overseas later that same year, where he would eventually finish his professional career. He played a season with the Finnish Tapiolan Honka basketball club in 1999–2000 and returned to Australia where he retired after playing for the Victoria Giants. In 2010, Jordan returned to basketball with the Chelsea Gulls of the Big V, a Victorian basketball league. Later that year, he became a coach with the Nunawading Spectres. Jordan appeared in the 1994 basketball film, Blue Chips as the starting point guard for a college team called Coast. After retiring from basketball, Jordan accepted an offer to coach the Topeka Tornado of the short-lived semi-pro All-American Professional Basketball League in 2005.

He played three seasons of college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels under Dean Smith and later Bill Guthridge. During the 1997–98 season, he was a member of new coach Guthridge\'s ""Six Starters"" system that also featured Antawn Jamison, Shammond Williams, Ed Cota, Ademola Okulaja, and Makhtar N\'Diaye. During his sophomore and junior seasons, Carter helped North Carolina to consecutive ACC men\'s basketball tournament titles and Final Four appearances. He finished the 1997–98 season with a 15.6 points per game average and was named second-team All-American, First-Team All-ACC, and to the fan\'s guide third-annual Coaches ACC All-Defensive Team. In May 1998 after his junior year, Carter declared for the 1998 NBA draft, following his classmate Jamison, who had declared earlier that spring. During his NBA career, Carter continued his coursework at North Carolina, and in August 2000, he graduated with a degree in Afro-American studies, squeezing in attendance at May 2001 graduation ceremonies at North Carolina before leaving to make a Raptors\' playoff game in Philadelphia. = Carter was initially drafted by the Golden State Warriors with the fifth overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft. He was then immediately traded to the Toronto Raptors for the fourth overall pick, Antawn Jamison on draft night. The Raptors had struggled in their first three years as a franchise. Carter was instrumental in leading the Raptors to their first-ever playoff appearance in 2000 before going on to lead them to a 47-win season and their first-ever playoff series win in 2001, advancing them to the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Due to the 1998–99 NBA lockout, Carter did not begin playing in the NBA until February 1999. Carter quickly became a fan favorite with a soaring offensive game that earned him the nickname ""Air Canada"". He won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award after averaging 18.3 points and throwing down countless highlight-reel dunks. Carter ascended to full-fledged stardom in his second season—he averaged 25.7 points per game (fourth-highest in the league) and lifted Toronto to its first playoff appearance in franchise history. He subsequently earned his first NBA All-Star selection and was named to the All-NBA Third Team. During the 2000 NBA All-Star Weekend, Carter showcased arguably the most memorable Slam Dunk Contest event in its history. He won the contest by performing an array of dunks including a 360° windmill, a between-the-legs bounce dunk, and an ""elbow in the rim"" dunk (also known as a ""cookie jar"" dunk or the ""honey dip""). Carter and his second cousin once removed, Tracy McGrady, formed a formidable one-two punch as teammates in Toronto between 1998 and 2000. However, McGrady left in free agency to the Orlando Magic in August 2000, leaving Carter as the Raptors\' franchise player. In 2000–01, his third season, Carter averaged a career-high 27.6 points per game, made the All-NBA Second Team, and was voted in as a starter for the 2001 NBA All-Star Game. The Raptors finished the regular season with a then franchise-record 47 wins. In the playoffs, the Raptors beat the New York Knicks 3–2 in the first round and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals to face off against the Philadelphia 76ers. Carter and 76ers star Allen Iverson both dominated in a seven-game series that see-sawed back and forth. Carter scored 50 points in Game 3 and set an NBA playoff record for most three-point field goals made in one game. In Game 7, Carter missed a potential game-winning shot with 2.0 seconds remaining. Iverson said of the series in July 2011: ""It was incredible. (Carter) had great games at home and I had some great games at home, but both of us were just trying to put our teams on our back and win basketball games. It is great just having those memories and being a part of something like that."" In August 2001, Carter signed a six-year contract extension worth as much as $94 million. Carter missed the final 22 games of the 2001–02 regular season due to injury. He started in 60 games and averaged 24.7 points per game.

In the semifinal against Texas, he scored 18 points. However, Warrick is best known for his blocked shot in the National Championship game against Kansas. Leading by three with under 15 seconds left, Warrick missed two free throws that would've sealed the game with Syracuse hanging on to a three-point lead, 81–78. With 1.5 seconds left and the score still the same, Kansas' Michael Lee was wide-open from the baseline for a potential game-tying 3-pointer. But Warrick used his long arms to block Lee's attempt and Syracuse captured its first ever national championship. Team USA Warrick was one of 16 finalists for the 2003 USA Basketball Men's Pan American Games Team. However, he did not make the cut. = After Carmelo Anthony declared early for the NBA draft, Warrick became the team's top scoring option. He led the team in scoring (19.8) and rebounds (8.6), and was named to the second-team All-America teams by ESPN.com and The Sporting News."", '1 high school senior in the class of 2002, ranked second by College Basketball News and third by All-Star Sports. Due to his struggles with the ACT, his family and friends wondered whether Anthony would forget about his college plans to attend Syracuse and move on to the NBA. He had yet to produce the minimum score of 18; however, in late April Anthony got a 19 and decided to stick with college and prepared for his freshman year at Syracuse. In April 2009, he was named to the ESPN RISE\'s all-decade team and was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald\'s All-Americans in January 2012. Anthony played one season at Syracuse University, during the 2002–03 season, where he averaged 22.2 points (16th in the NCAA, fourth in the Big East) and 10.0 rebounds (19th in the NCAA, third in the Big East, first among NCAA Division I freshmen). He helped guide the Orangemen to their first ever NCAA tournament title in 2003. He led the team in scoring, rebounding, minutes played (36.4 minutes per game), field goals made and free throws made and attempted. Anthony\'s 33-point outburst against the University of Texas in the Final Four set an NCAA tournament record for most points by a freshman. In the championship game against the University of Kansas, Anthony had 20 points and 10 rebounds. For his efforts during the NCAA tournament, Anthony earned the tournament\'s Most Outstanding Player Award. Afterwards, Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim described Anthony as ""[...] by far, the best player in college basketball. It wasn\'t even close.', ""1 in the nation. Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Walker was listed as the No. 5 point guard and the No. 14 player in the nation in 2008. = During his freshman year at the University of Connecticut, Walker played in every contest and was named to the Big East All-Rookie Team. He helped the Huskies achieve a number one seed in the 2009 NCAA tournament. Despite starting in only two games, he averaged 25.5 minutes per contest, easily far more than any regular non-starter. He also helped the Huskies advance to the 2009 Final Four with a 23-point effort in the Elite Eight versus Missouri. = During the Huskies' 2009–2010 season, Walker started in all 34 of their games and contributed an average of 14.6 points. He also led the team in scoring for the eighth time in the last nine games of the season, with 18 points at Virginia Tech. Walker was named by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) to the First Team All-District. Connecticut clinched a 4-seed in the NCAA's 2010 National Invitation Tournament only to fall short to Virginia Tech and finish the relatively disappointing season going 18–16 (7–11) in conference play. = Walker rose to national prominence in his third year at Connecticut. This was because, twelve games into his junior campaign, he distinguished himself as the leading scorer in the nation, posting 26.7 points per contest; in addition, Walker averaged 5 rebounds and 3.8 assists. It was then that he appeared on one of the six regional covers of Sports Illustrated magazine. In the 2011 Big East tournament, Walker hit the game-clinching shot at the buzzer to beat the Pittsburgh Panthers, ranked No. 3 overall, thereby advancing the Huskies to the semifinals. Walker led UConn to victory in the ensuing Big East Championship against the Louisville Cardinals and earned tournament MVP honors in the process. Over five games in as many days, Walker tallied an unprecedented 130 points, a record of points scored for not only the Big East but for any conference tournament in the past 15 seasons. UConn thus became the first school to win five games in five days and earn a conference championship. On March 14, 2011, the U.S. Basketball Writers Association named Walker First Team All-American with only Fox Sports picking him to the Second Team. His heroic performance in the 2010–11 season also made him a finalist for the Association's college player of the year honors, the Oscar Robertson Trophy. Despite finishing second to Jimmer Fredette for this award, at least several journalists held that it was rather Walker who deserved the distinction of best player that year. Among other accolades bestowed on him, Walker claimed the Bob Cousy Award for college basketball's top point guard in the nation. On April 4, 2011, Walker, with 16 points himself, rallied and led the University of Connecticut to win the Division I Championship, while he won the honor of NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player. Upon the team's return from Houston, at a pep rally to celebrate the National Title, Walker was added to the Huskies of Honor. He became the first men's basketball player to receive the distinction since the inaugural class was announced in December 2006. = 2011–12 season: Rookie season Walker graduated from UConn in three years. Accordingly, he entered the 2011 NBA draft and was selected ninth overall by the Charlotte Bobcats. Walker signed a multi-year shoe deal with Under Armour, the first rookie from the 2011 draft class to do so. On December 11, 2011, he signed the rookie scale contract with the Bobcats, and with the injury of point guard D."", 'He was released on December 16. Carter played a total of six years in the NBA with the Los Angeles Lakers (1980–1981), Indiana Pacers (1981–1984), New York Knicks (1984–1985), and Philadelphia 76ers (1985). He averaged 8.7 points per game over the six seasons. He held the NBA record for most points in an overtime period (14) for twenty years until surpassed by Earl Boykins. From 1987 to 1989, after leaving the NBA, Carter returned to his alma mater, Middletown High School. There, he improved the team from a previous losing record to an 18–3 record. He was acknowledged for this two-year turnaround by being named Ohio Basketball High School Coach of the Year. Carter is the only person to be named both Player and Coach of the Year in the state of Ohio. Carter served as an assistant basketball coach at Long Beach State for Joe Harrington 1989. From 1990 to 1991, he was an assistant coach at the University of Dayton. = Carter served as an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks from 1991 to 1996 under Frank Hamblen (1991) and Mike Dunleavy (1992–1996). He was promoted to the position of the Bucks scout in 1996–1997. = During the 1997–1998 season, Carter served as an assistant coach for the Toronto Raptors under Darrell Walker. He was promoted to head coach midway through the 1997–1998 season after Walker resigned from the team with a franchise low 11–38 record. Carter finished the remainder of the season as interim Coach with a 5–28 record.[1] During the shortened 1998–99 NBA season, Carter coached the Raptors to a 23–27 record, improving the team\'s winning percentage by .308 from the all-time franchise low 16–66 season. Carter developed a reputation for developing young players, such as Rookie of the Year and NBA All-Star Vince Carter, and eventual NBA All-Star Tracy McGrady.[2] In the 1999–2000 season, Carter coached the Raptors to their first winning season (with a 45–37 record), resulting in the team\'s first playoff appearance. He became the first coach in NBA history to take a team from less than 20 wins to the playoffs in less than two years. However, the playoff berth was short-lived as the Raptors were eliminated in the first round by the Knicks. On June 14, 2000, Carter was fired. Richard Peddie, then president and CEO of the owner of the Raptors, accused Carter of trying to take general manager Glen Grunwald\'s job, which Carter denied, saying he only asked for the assistant general manager position. In 2000, Carter published his autobiography (co-written with his brother Cris Carter). In the book, he detailed playing under Indiana University coach, Bobby Knight, including how one night, Knight stormed into the locker room after a practice and chewed out another player, saying he would end up like ""all the rest of the n------ in Chicago, including your brothers."" Knight denied the claim and former teammates Isiah Thomas and Mike Woodson denied ever hearing Knight use the slur. Knight and Carter also had issues after the coach learned how Carter had used athletic department phones for more than $1,000 in long-distance calls.', 'And this was going on for about an hour and I was like \'did I come to IU for this?\' So he (Knight) hollers up and says \'Well, I guess I\'ve got to put up with your ass for another three years. Get on down here.\'"" In Woodson\'s sophomore year, the 1977–78 season, the Hoosiers finished the regular season with an overall record of 21–8 and a conference record of 12–6, finishing 2nd in the Big Ten Conference and advancing to the Sweet Sixteen in the 1978 NCAA Tournament. In Woodson\'s junior year, the 1978–79 season, he served as captain of the Hoosier team. During the final game that season, against Illinois, word leaked out that Big Ten coaches had left Woodson off their all-conference first team, despite averaging 21 points and 5.7 rebounds while shooting 50 percent from the field. Woodson proceeded to lead Indiana to victory and score a career high 48 points (including 29 at the half). At the post-game press conference, Coach Knight criticized the media voters. ""He just erupted,"" Woodson recalled. ""He was like \'how the hell can this guy not be on first team All-Big Ten,\' and then the next day they put me on first team All-Big Ten."" The Hoosiers went on to win the 1979 NIT Tournament. Following that season Woodson was selected to play for the United States in the 1979 Pan American Games on the basketball team coached by Indiana\'s Bob Knight. Behind Woodson\'s leadership as captain, the U.S. team compiled a 9–0 record and won the gold medal, while averaging 100.8 points a game—the first time that a United States team averaged more than 100 points-per-game in the Pan American Games. Following Woodson\'s team-leading 18.3 points per game, Coach Knight believed Woodson ""was the best player in the country, and headed for a spectacular senior season."" The 1979–80 Hoosiers, led by Woodson and Isiah Thomas, began the season ranked No. 1 in the polls after a rare 78–50 blow-out of the Soviet Union men\'s national basketball team and then went on to four straight college victories. But Hoosier star Randy Wittman broke his foot and Woodson was forced to miss seven weeks due to back surgery on a herniated disc. Hobbled by these injuries, the team dropped to a 7–5 conference record, but upon Woodson\'s return on Valentine\'s Day with a win against Iowa, the Hoosiers went on a six-game winning streak and finished with a conference record of 13–5, finishing 1st in the Big Ten Conference. After winning the 1984 NBA All-Star MVP, Isiah Thomas was asked if that was his biggest basketball thrill, to which Thomas replied, ""No, my biggest thrill was my freshman year at Indiana when Mike Woodson came back from back surgery and hit his first three jump shots at Iowa."" The team advanced to the 1980 Sweet Sixteen and ended the season with an overall record of 21–8. Woodson finished his career at Indiana with 1,279 points in conference games (11th all-time) and 2,061 points in all games. Despite playing just six conference games his senior year and missing seven weeks, Woodson was named the Big Ten\'s Most Valuable Player and an National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) All-American, and received the Chicago Tribune Silver Basketball award. Among Hoosier basketball players, Woodson ranks fifth all-time in total points and his 19.8 points per game average is tied (with Calbert Cheaney) for the second highest by a Hoosier who played four seasons in college. The New York Knicks selected Woodson 12th overall in the 1980 NBA draft.', ""As a senior in 2003–04, he averaged 28.7 points, 15.5 rebounds, 5.1 blocked shots and 5.2 assists. He was subsequently named a McDonald's All-American and earned first-team Parade All-American honors. Williams played a lone season at North Carolina in 2004–05, helping the Tar Heels win the NCAA championship. His tip-in with 1:26 remaining in the NCAA final against Illinois broke a 70–70 tie, propelling UNC to a 75–70 victory.

He was recruited by UConn after drawing the attention of coach Jim Calhoun, who felt that Lamb reminded him of former UConn star Richard ""Rip"" Hamilton. Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Lamb was listed as the No. 19 shooting guard and the No. 76 player in the nation in 2010. During his freshman year at UConn, Lamb played in every game.

Morris\' girlfriend Amber Soulds gave birth to a son, Marcus Jr., on July 20, 2018. Beginning with the 2018–19 season, Morris donned ""Morris Sr."" on the back of his gameday jersey. The Morris brothers and former teammates Goran and Zoran Dragić all briefly played for the Suns during the fourth quarter of the team\'s January 2, 2015 112–96 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. It marked the first time in the NBA\'s history that two pairs of brothers were on the court for the same team at the same time. On February 26, 2012, the state of Kansas filed battery charges against Morris and another assailant, Julius K. Harris, for punching an employee of the Cave, a bar and nightclub in Lawrence, Kansas in which they had been watching the final Border War basketball match between Kansas and Missouri. Morris and Harris entered a diversion agreement for the battery charge, with Morris paying a $300 diversion fee, $60 in court fees, and agreeing not to come in contact with the victim or The Cave for one year.

In spite of the resolution the incident was considered a catalyst for the Suns trading Marcus to the Pistons on July 9, 2015 and a factor in dealing his brother to the Washington Wizards on February 18, 2016. On January 11, 2024, Morris was awarded the key to the City of Philadelphia for his contributions on and off the court.

Parker entered the 1997 NBA draft after four years at Bradley and was selected 21st overall by the New Jersey Nets, but he was immediately traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in a multi-player trade.

He finished the remainder of the season with the Quad City Thunder of the Continental Basketball Association where he averaged 11.5 points in 26 games. = Disappointed in his failure to make a breakthrough in the NBA, Parker turned to Europe to resurrect his basketball career, intending to return to the NBA after a good season with a European club. Eventually, he moved to Israel in the 2000–01 season, where he was signed by the Israeli EuroLeague powerhouse Maccabi Tel Aviv.

In his final season with Maccabi, he led the team to another domestic double, but in the Euroleague 2005–06 season\'s championship game, Maccabi was defeated 73–69 by CSKA Moscow.

On July 27, 1993, during off-season practice at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, Lewis suffered sudden cardiac death on the basketball court at the age of 27. Two Brandeis University police officers found Lewis and attempted to revive him using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but they were unsuccessful. One of the officers was James Crowley. Lewis is buried in an unmarked grave in Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. His death was attributed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a structural heart defect that is the most common cause of death in young athletes. = Following Lewis\' death, questions were raised about whether he had used cocaine, and whether cocaine use had contributed to his death. The Wall Street Journal reported that physicians ""suspected that cocaine killed Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis...but they were thwarted by actions of his family and a \'dismissive\' policy toward drugs by the NBA."" The Journal added the following: Whether Mr. Lewis died from a heart damaged by cocaine -- as many doctors suspected then and now -- cannot be definitively shown. What is evident: The official cause of death, a heart damaged by a common-cold virus, is a medically nonsensical finding by a coroner who was under intense pressure from the Lewis family to exclude any implication of drug use. The Boston Celtics responded by expressing sadness about the ""vicious attack on Reggie Lewis and his family"" and threatening ""to file a $100 million lawsuit against the reporter, The Wall Street Journal, and its parent company, Dow Jones and Co. Inc."" Dr. Gilbert Mudge, a doctor who treated Lewis, was sued for malpractice in connection with Lewis\' death; in written responses to questions from the attorneys for Donna Harris-Lewis, Mudge said that ""16 days before Lewis collapsed from a heart attack in 1993, he acknowledged having used cocaine, but said he had stopped."" On the other hand, the doctor who performed the autopsy on Lewis testified that the scarring on his heart was inconsistent with cocaine use, and other doctors reached the same conclusion though they ""stopped short of saying he never used drugs."" Also, Lewis\'s heart tissue tested positive for adenovirus (a common virus that can cause a range of cold- or flu-like infections) during his autopsy.

On March 15, 2010, Hunter broke her silence during an interview with GQ magazine and provided new details about the affair. In March 2011, voicemail messages allegedly left by John Edwards were obtained, which Young says prove that Edwards arranged the cover-up of his affair with Hunter. On May 24, 2011, ABC News and the New York Times reported that the U.S Department of Justice\'s Public Integrity Section had conducted a two-year investigation into whether Edwards had used more than $1 million in political donations to hide his affair and planned to pursue criminal charges for alleged violations of campaign finance laws. On June 3, 2011, Edwards was indicted by a federal grand jury in North Carolina on six felony charges, including four counts of collecting illegal campaign contributions, one count of conspiracy, and one count of making false statements. After postponing the start of the trial while Edwards was treated for a heart condition in February 2012, Judge Catherine Eagles of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina scheduled jury selection to begin on April 12, 2012. Edwards\'s trial began on April 23, 2012, as he faced up to 30 years in prison and a $1.5 million fine. In a related development, on March 13, 2012, the Federal Election Commission ruled that Edwards\'s campaign must repay $2.1 million in matching federal funds. Edwards\'s lawyers claimed the money was used, and that the campaign did not receive all the funds to which it was entitled, but the Commission rejected the arguments. Twelve jurors and four alternates were seated, and opening arguments began April 23, 2012. Closing arguments took place May 17, and the case went to the jury the next day. On May 31, 2012, Edwards was found not guilty on Count 3, illegal use of campaign funding (contributions from Rachel ""Bunny"" Mellon), while mistrials were declared on all other counts against him. On June 13, 2012, the Justice Department announced that it dropped the charges and would not attempt to retry Edwards. After his political career ended, Edwards, along with attorneys David Kirby and William Bystrynski, founded the law firm Edwards Kirby in Raleigh, specializing in medical malpractice cases. In 2015, his daughter Cate was the managing attorney of the San Diego office of the firm.

In October 2021, he condemned Xi Jinping, the Chinese paramount leader, as a ""brutal dictator"" and expressed his support for the Free Tibet movement on Twitter. In retaliation, the Chinese government stopped streaming all Boston Celtics games. Also in October, he led a rally in Washington, D.C., urging the U.S. Congress to pass the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a law that would limit imports from the alleged areas where China has oppressed Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz minorities. In November 2021, Kanter appeared in interviews on Fox News and CNN advocating for the boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in China. On December 6, 2021, the United States announced a diplomatic boycott of the games, meaning that athletes may still participate but no ""diplomatic or official representation"" will be sent from the United States government. After Kanter was waived out of his most recent contract, he claimed he was pushed out of the NBA to appease the Chinese state. Adam Silver and the NBA have denied that Kanter\'s activism led to him being blackballed. In June 2022, Kanter took part in a press conference with Canadian Senator Leo Housakos and Canadian MP Garnett Genuis. In this press conference, Kanter spoke about how his interest in the Uighurs in China began. The Canadian Government was called upon to halt the importation of goods that were made with forced labor from the province of Xinjiang. In January 2023, Kanter sat down with journalist John Stossel in an interview titled, ""The FULL Enes Kanter Freedom: On China, NBA Hypocrisy, LeBron & Cena"", where he summarized his experiences pushing back against countries, including China, that don\'t allow freedom of speech for their citizens, and criticized LeBron James and John Cena for their China ties. = Kanter has also met with several US congressional members, including former Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi and current Republican speaker Mike Johnson, attending the 2024 State of the Union as a guest of the latter. He then stated he plans to run for Congress in 2028, when he will have been a US citizen for 7 years and eligible to do so. In 2019, he wrote in The Washington Post about the challenge of observing Ramadan during the NBA playoffs, which includes daytime fasting while still playing NBA basketball games. He has said that he learned English during college by watching SpongeBob SquarePants and Jersey Shore. He began following a plant-based diet in 2020, with the goal of switching to a vegan lifestyle. Kanter became an American citizen on November 29, 2021, and also legally changed his name to Enes Kanter Freedom at the same time to mark the occasion. During the summer of 2018, Kanter held 16 free basketball camps in the United States. Also in the same year, Kanter started a fundraiser for wildfire victims in Greece.

Turnhout: Brepols.', 'He became our contemporary."" James\'s letters to expatriate American sculptor Hendrik Christian Andersen have attracted particular attention. James met the 27-year-old Andersen in Rome in 1899, when James was 56, and wrote letters to Andersen that are intensely emotional: ""I hold you, dearest boy, in my innermost love, & count on your feeling me—in every throb of your soul"". In a letter of 6 May 1904, to his brother William, James referred to himself as ""always your hopelessly celibate even though sexagenarian Henry"". How accurate that description might have been is the subject of contention among James\'s biographers, but the letters to Andersen were occasionally quasierotic: ""I put, my dear boy, my arm around you, & feel the pulsation, thereby, as it were, of our excellent future & your admirable endowment."" His numerous letters to the many young homosexual men among his close male friends are more forthcoming. To his homosexual friend Howard Sturgis, James could write: ""I repeat, almost to indiscretion, that I could live with you. Meanwhile, I can only try to live without you."" In another letter Sturgis, following a long visit, James refers jocularly to their ""happy little congress of two"". In letters to Hugh Walpole, he pursues convoluted jokes and puns about their relationship, referring to himself as an elephant who ""paws you oh so benevolently"" and winds about Walpole his ""well-meaning old trunk"". His letters to Walter Berry printed by the Black Sun Press have long been celebrated for their lightly veiled eroticism. However, James corresponded in equally extravagant language with his many female friends, writing, for example, to fellow novelist Lucy Clifford: ""Dearest Lucy! What shall I say? when I love you so very, very much, and see you nine times for once that I see Others! Therefore I think that—if you want it made clear to the meanest intelligence—I love you more than I love Others."" To his New York friend Mary Cadwalader Rawle Jones: ""Dearest Mary Cadwalader. I yearn over you, but I yearn in vain; & your long silence really breaks my heart, mystifies, depresses, almost alarms me, to the point even of making me wonder if poor unconscious & doting old Célimare [Jones\'s pet name for James] has \'done\' anything, in some dark somnambulism of the spirit, which has ... given you a bad moment, or a wrong impression, or a \'colourable pretext\' ... However these things may be, he loves you as tenderly as ever; nothing, to the end of time, will ever detach him from you, & he remembers those Eleventh St. matutinal intimes hours, those telephonic matinées, as the most romantic of his life ..."" His long friendship with American novelist Constance Fenimore Woolson, in whose house he lived for a number of weeks in Italy in 1887, and his shock and grief over her suicide in 1894, are discussed in detail in Edel\'s biography and play a central role in a study by Lyndall Gordon. Edel conjectured that Woolson was in love with James and killed herself in part because of his coldness, but Woolson\'s biographers have objected to Edel\'s account. = James is one of the major figures of trans-Atlantic literature. His works frequently juxtapose characters from the Old World (Europe), embodying a feudal civilisation that is beautiful, often corrupt, and alluring, and from the New World (United States), where people are often brash, open, and assertive, and embody the virtues of the new American society—particularly personal freedom and a more exacting moral character. James explores this clash of personalities and cultures, in stories of personal relationships in which power is exercised well or badly. His protagonists were often young American women facing oppression or abuse, and as his secretary Theodora Bosanquet remarked in her monograph Henry James at Work: When he walked out of the refuge of his study and into the world and looked around him, he saw a place of torment, where creatures of prey perpetually thrust their claws into the quivering flesh of doomed, defenseless children of light ... His novels are a repeated exposure of this wickedness, a reiterated and passionate plea for the fullest freedom of development, unimperiled by reckless and barbarous stupidity. Philip Guedalla jokingly described three phases in the development of James\'s prose: ""James I, James II, and The Old Pretender,"" and observers do often group his works of fiction into three periods. In his apprentice years, culminating with the masterwork The Portrait of a Lady, his style was simple and direct (by the standards of Victorian magazine writing) and he experimented widely with forms and methods, generally narrating from a conventionally omniscient point of view. Plots generally concern romance, except for the three big novels of social commentary that conclude this period. In the second period, as noted above, he abandoned the serialised novel and from 1890 to about 1897, he wrote short stories and plays. Finally, in his third and last period he returned to the long, serialised novel. Beginning in the second period, but most noticeably in the third; he increasingly abandoned direct statement in favour of frequent double negatives, and complex descriptive imagery. Single paragraphs began to run for page after page, in which an initial noun would be succeeded by pronouns surrounded by clouds of adjectives and prepositional clauses, far from their original referents, and verbs would be deferred and then preceded by a series of adverbs. The overall effect could be a vivid evocation of a scene as perceived by a sensitive observer. It has been debated whether this change of style was engendered by James\'s shifting from writing to dictating to a typist, a change made during the composition of What Maisie Knew. In its intense focus on the consciousness of his major characters, James\'s later work foreshadows extensive developments in 20th-century fiction. Indeed, he might have influenced stream-of-consciousness writers such as Virginia Woolf, who not only read some of his novels but also wrote essays about them. Both contemporary and modern readers have found the late style difficult and unnecessary; his friend Edith Wharton, who admired him greatly, said that some passages in his work were all but incomprehensible. James was harshly portrayed by H.', 'John M.', ""In Earthforce! An Earth Warrior's Guide to Strategy, Watson expressed disdain for the truthfulness of mainstream media: The nature of the mass media today is such that the truth is irrelevant.

Peterson\'s stepbrother, Thomas Morphey, who has a history of drug and alcohol addiction, attempted suicide two days after allegedly helping Peterson carry a plastic container from Peterson\'s Bolingbrook home to his SUV, fearing he may have helped dispose of Stacy\'s body. Neighbors reported seeing Peterson and another man hauling a 55-gallon barrel, large enough to hold a person, out of the house shortly after the disappearance. Cassandra Cales, Stacy\'s sister, said she wanted Peterson to take a lie detector test about his knowledge of a blue container that she saw in his garage two days before Stacy disappeared. Joel Brodsky, Peterson\'s attorney, denied that any container was missing from Peterson\'s home. There were also reports of truckers referring to the containers, but their stories were treated as not credible after it was discovered that they had not been in the Bolingbrook area at the times they claimed. = On January 23, 2008, Peterson and his attorney, Joel Brodsky, called in to the show of Chicago radio personality Steve Dahl, who had been lampooning Peterson since the case began. Brodsky suggested that Dahl host an on-air ""dating game"" with Peterson the following day, but WJMK managers and Dahl decided not to go through with it. Peterson appeared on CNN\'s Larry King Live on April 11, 2008, with Brodsky again present to advise which questions Peterson should answer. The interview reran on May 9, 2009, two days after Peterson\'s arrest. Peterson subsequently made guest appearances (including one from county jail) on radio station WLS-AM with Mancow Muller. After that radio appearance, Will County Judge Stephen White severely limited Peterson\'s access to the media. = In December 2008, Peterson\'s publicist Glenn Selig confirmed Peterson was engaged to a 23-year-old, Christina Raines; she would have been his fifth wife. On January 30, 2009, it was made public that Raines had moved out of Peterson\'s house. Her father, Ernie Raines, had issued an ultimatum to his daughter out of concern about the way Peterson tried to control her and what he feared Peterson could do. Raines moved out of Peterson\'s home ""when she came to her senses"", calling the engagement a publicity stunt designed to keep Peterson in the media spotlight. = On May 7, 2009, Peterson was indicted by a Will County grand jury and arrested for the murder of Savio. Bail was set at $20 million. In October 2009, Peterson sued JP Morgan Chase for revoking a home equity credit line that he wanted to use to pay legal expenses, claiming his income of ""nearly $109,000 per year"" was not sufficient. In July 2010, Judge White ruled that Peterson would remain in the Will County Jail for the remainder of his trial and appeals process. Prosecutors argued he could pose a danger if released. On July 21, 2010, it was revealed that hearsay statements indicating Peterson killed two of his wives were not reliable enough for a jury to hear at his trial. After presiding over a lengthy hearing, Judge White issued a four-page sealed ruling in May obtained by the Daily Herald. White ruled that prosecutors proved Peterson killed both Savio and Stacy ""by a preponderance of the evidence,"" but nearly all statements attributed to Stacy ""do not provide sufficient safeguards of reliability."" (The standard of proof in homicide cases is ""beyond a reasonable doubt""; ""preponderance of the evidence"" is the standard for fact-finding on questions of admissibility of evidence, even in a criminal case.) Stacy\'s statements were crucial to the prosecution\'s case, as it lacked significant direct evidence. In April 2012, an Illinois appellate court ruled that prosecutors could use eight statements made by both the victim prior to her death and by Peterson\'s still-missing fourth wife Stacy prior to her disappearance, reversing White\'s earlier decision. Peterson\'s defense had contended that introduction of these alleged hearsay comments constituted a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to confront any witnesses testifying against him. The Illinois State Legislature attempted to help the prosecution with the passage of a new Illinois law, 725 ILCS 5/115-10.6, or ""Drew\'s Law"", which allows prosecutors to enter hearsay statements into evidence under certain conditions. Passed while investigators were looking for Stacy, the legislation permits courts to consider statements from ""unavailable witnesses,"" provided that prosecutors are able to prove that the witness was killed to prevent his or her testimony and that the hearsay statements are reliable. Analysis by the trial court under this new law led to eight out of fourteen hearsay statements being ruled inadmissible because they were insufficiently reliable. On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court, ruling that the common law doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing, which is less restrictive than ""Drew\'s Law"", would allow the statements to be admitted. On August 22, 2012, Jeff Pachter, a witness at Peterson\'s murder trial, said Peterson offered him $25,000 to hire someone to kill Savio and told him it would be a secret he would take to his grave. = On September 6, 2012, Peterson was found guilty of the premeditated murder of Savio. Jurors admitted that the most compelling evidence was based on the hearsay statements allowed under ""Drew\'s Law"". On February 21, 2013, Peterson was sentenced to 38 years in prison for the murder of his third wife. He was incarcerated at Menard Correctional Center in Chester, Illinois, but later moved to the Federal Correctional Institution, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana. Within a month, he was attacked by another prisoner who hoped to sell his belongings on eBay. After a number of appeals, on September 21, 2017, the Illinois Supreme Court upheld the conviction. In December 2019, Peterson was released from federal custody and transferred to a state facility outside of Illinois. His location is not being disclosed for security reasons. The Illinois Department of Corrections stated, ""Drew Peterson has transferred from the Federal Bureau of Prisons to a state facility outside Illinois. He remains under the jurisdiction of the Illinois Department of Corrections. For safety and security purposes, the department does not discuss details concerning the placement of offenders who have transferred under the terms of the Interstate Corrections Compact Agreement."" In October 2021, Peterson filed a hand-written Petition for Post Conviction Relief with the Will County Circuit Clerk. The petition alleges, amongst other claims, that State\'s Attorney James Glasgow had intimidated witnesses during Peterson\'s 2012 murder trial. The petition also revealed Peterson\'s current location of incarceration: The Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, Indiana, where he is known as Inmate #279193. = On February 9, 2015, Peterson was charged with attempting to put a hit on James Glasgow, the Chicago-area lead prosecutor in his murder trial, after a fellow inmate tipped off prosecutors to the plan and wore a wire to capture evidence against Peterson. In May 2016, he was found guilty of solicitation of murder and solicitation of murder for hire. He was subsequently sentenced to an additional 40 years in prison. = In May 2022, it was revealed that Drew Peterson\'s former defense attorney, Joel Brodsky, is considering the release of confidential information protected by attorney-client privilege. Stacy Peterson\'s sister, Cassandra, was annoyed by the possibility that Brodsky could face legal penalties for revealing such information, as she felt that it may be the needed information to solve Stacy\'s cold case. Cassandra argued that she would stand by Brodsky and support his actions if he came forward. Brodsky had temporarily lost his legal license in 2019 (for reasons unrelated to the Drew Peterson case), and is under a continued gag order not to disclose anything that Drew Peterson shared with him in confidentiality. It is unclear if Brodsky actually knows any information about the whereabouts of Stacy Peterson, although he has claimed that he does, stating, ""I know everything about both of his wives – everything. I feel bad about Drew still not taking responsibility and Stacy still being missing. I\'m thinking about maybe revealing what happened to Stacy and where she is."" The Drew Peterson crimes and suspicions were covered in the OWN series Dr. Phil, episode ""A Killer Among Us"", original air date: December 7, 2007. In June 2011, the cable television network Lifetime began filming Drew Peterson: Untouchable, depicting the events surrounding the death of Savio and the disappearance of Stacy. Rob Lowe portrayed Peterson in the film, Cara Buono portrayed Savio, and Kaley Cuoco portrayed Stacy. Peterson filed a cease-and-desist letter demanding that production on the movie be halted.', 'Basketball reference.com page\n\n', 'It\'s a dirty, dark secret; I\'m glad it\'s coming out.

Barkley has also been known as a critic of President Donald Trump from as early as his Republican nomination in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Before Trump won the Republican primaries that year, Barkley stated his disgust towards the words and messages that Trump was promoting throughout the presidential race. In September 2017, when President Trump called out former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for his kneeling during the U.S. National Anthem during the 2016 NFL season, Barkley expressed his complete disappointment in President Trump (however, Barkley has stated that he does not support athletes kneeling during the National Anthem as a form of protest). In December 2017, Barkley mocked President Trump\'s tax bill, stating ""Thank you Republicans, I knew I could always count on y\'all to take care of us rich people, us one percenters. Sorry, poor people. I\'m hoping for y\'all, but y\'all ain\'t got no chance."" In his response to the controversy generated by the removal of Confederate monuments as highlighted by the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Barkley stated: I\'ve never thought about those statues a day in my life.

During Alabama\'s Senate election, Barkley argued that Jones\' competitor, Roy Moore, should have been disqualified: ""How can you have a guy who\'s running with a white separatist running for a political office?"" While Barkley supports police and prison reforms, he spoke out against defunding the police in 2020, saying ""Who are black people supposed to call? The Ghostbusters?"". After the killing of Breonna Taylor, Barkley said that ""I feel sad that this young lady lost her life."", but added that ""we do have to take into account that her boyfriend shot at the cops and shot a cop."", making her situation not ""like George Floyd or Ahmaud Arbery"".

In a tweet on October 28, Nets owner Joseph Tsai said he was ""disappointed that Kyrie appears to support a film based on a book full of anti-semitic disinformation"", and expressed his intent to address the issue further with Irving. On October 29, 2022, Irving tweeted that deeming him antisemitic was ""not justified"", and that he intended to ""learn from all walks of life and religions."" The same day, during a postgame press availability at Barclays Center, Irving denied having any religious biases and defended the tweet, telling reporters that ""[h]istory is not supposed to be hidden from anybody"" and stating, ""I\'m not going to stand down on anything I believe in.

On October 31, during a game between the Nets and the Indiana Pacers at Barclays Center, several attendees sitting courtside wore shirts bearing the phrase ""Fight Antisemitism"", an apparent reference to Irving\'s tweet. Two days later, Irving and the Nets jointly announced they would each donate US$500,000 to organizations combating religious hatred, and would work with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) to create programming related to opposing antisemitism. Though he did not apologize for promoting the film, Irving was quoted as saying that he opposes ""all forms of hatred and oppression and stand[s] strong with communities that are marginalized and impacted every day""; Irving added that he ""[took] responsibility"" for the impact of his tweet on the Jewish community. In a subsequent statement of his own, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who is Jewish, criticized Irving for ""not offer[ing] an unqualified apology"" or expressly denouncing the film\'s content, and said he would meet with Irving ""in the next week to discuss this situation."" During a press availability on November 3, Irving admitted that some of the film\'s content was ""unfortunate"" and untrue, but did not apologize for promoting the film, saying he was ""not the one who made the documentary."" Irving suggested that focus on his promotion of the film was unfairly diverting attention away from African-American history, declaring at one point that ""300 million of [his] ancestors are buried in America""; Irving added that he would be able to debunk any criticism leveled at him because of his propensity for ""study[ing]"", and that he ""know[s] the Oxford dictionary."" Asked directly if Irving held antisemitic beliefs, he did not give a yes-or-no response, saying only, ""I cannot be antisemitic if I know where I come from."" That night, the Nets announced that they had suspended Irving without pay for at least five games, due to his ""failure to disavow antisemitism when given a clear opportunity to do so"" and ""conduct detrimental to the team."" ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt tweeted that Irving\'s suspension was ""well-deserved"", and said the ADL would reject Irving\'s previously announced donation. Four hours after the Nets\' initial announcement of his suspension, Irving finally issued an apology via Instagram, writing in part, ""To All Jewish families and Communities that are hurt and affected from my post, I am deeply sorry to have caused you pain, and I apologize...I had no intentions to disrespect any Jewish cultural history regarding the Holocaust or perpetuate any hate.', 'Moormann, Peter (2010).

Murray was born and raised in Kitchener, Ontario, the son of Sylvia (from Syria) and Roger Murray (born in Jamaica and moved to Canada at age nine). He also has a younger brother, Lamar. His father grew up running track and field and playing basketball; as a youth, his father played against Kitchener resident Lennox Lewis before Lewis began his professional boxing career. When Murray was three years old, he could play basketball ""for hours"" and at age six played in a league for ten-year-olds. By the age of 12 or 13, he began playing pick-up games against top high school and college players. His father put him through many basketball drills and kung fu exercises, including meditation. Murray\'s father, a lifelong fan of Bruce Lee, employed Lee\'s teachings when he raised his son, and Murray has credited Lee for influencing the way he approaches basketball. Murray attended Grand River Collegiate Institute in Kitchener, later transferring to Orangeville Prep in Orangeville, Ontario, where his father served as an assistant coach. He and fellow prospect Thon Maker formed a duo that helped Orangeville Prep defeat many American schools. At the 2013 Jordan Brand Classic International Game, Murray was named MVP, becoming the second Canadian to win the award after Duane Notice. At the 2015 Nike Hoop Summit, Murray scored a game-high 30 points and was named the MVP. Murray was named MVP of the 2015 BioSteel All-Canadian Basketball Game, which includes the top high school players in Canada. Murray played AAU basketball for the CIA Bounce.

In which year did Manu Ginobili become the Spurs' career leader in steals?,"['He is one of only two players in basketball history (along with Bill Bradley) to win the EuroLeague, an Olympic gold medal, and an NBA championship ring. Ginóbili is also the first non-U.S. player to win both the NBA championship ring and the Olympic gold medal, and the second Latin American to be selected to play in an NBA All-Star game (after Panama\'s Rolando Blackman). The Spurs made the NBA playoffs in each of his 16 NBA seasons. In 2007, ESPN sportswriter John Hollinger ranked Ginóbili as the sixth-best international player then active in the NBA, describing Ginobili as ""one of the great draft heists of all time"" and attributing the trend of NBA teams drafting developing European players to the success of the Argentine. The following year, Ginóbili was named by ESPN as one of the best EuroLeague players to have graced the NBA.

During the season, Ginóbili became only the fourth person to win consecutive Olimpias de Oro, this time sharing the award with soccer star Carlos Tevez. The 2005–06 season was an injury-plagued one for Ginóbili, who suffered foot and ankle injuries that hindered his ability to play. Ginóbili managed 65 games in the regular season, but saw a dip in major statistics as compared to the previous season. During the playoffs, he returned to form, but was unable to prevent the Spurs from being eliminated by the Dallas Mavericks in the Conference Semifinals. In the 2006–07 season, the Spurs lacked energy from their reserves. Ginóbili came off the bench for most of the second half of the season, helping the Spurs attain the league's best record during that portion of the season. Ginóbili produced numbers closely identical to his successful 2004–05 campaign despite starting in only 36 of 75 games, his second-lowest number of starts since arriving at San Antonio. The 2007 NBA Playoffs saw him help the Spurs to defeat the Denver Nuggets, Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz; the team then swept the Cleveland Cavaliers for Ginobili's third and San Antonio's fourth championship. Ginóbili was to play an even bigger role for the Spurs the following season, reaching career high averages in points, rebounds, assists, and three-point field goal percentage. On 11 February 2008, he scored 34 points and recorded 15 rebounds in a 93–88 win over the Toronto Raptors, becoming the first guard in Spurs' history to have at least 15 points and 15 rebounds in a game.

He had a statline of 19.5 points, 4.5 assists, and 4.8 rebounds on .460 shooting averaging 31.1 minutes. Only a couple of weeks later, the Argentine was also named to the All-NBA Third Team. In the playoffs, the Spurs defeated the Suns 4–1 in the first round, and Ginóbili was moved to the starting lineup in the second round against the New Orleans Hornets after the Spurs lost the first two road games. San Antonio eventually prevailed in seven games, the Argentine played another strong series, leading the Spurs in points and assists per game (21.3 and 6.0 respectively). However, San Antonio lost to arch-rivals Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals in five games, and once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships. The following season, Ginóbili was injured for most of the campaign, managing only 44 regular-season games and missing the 2009 NBA Playoffs entirely. San Antonio qualified for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54–28 record, but with an aging supporting cast (Bowen, Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s), the Spurs were only considered fringe contenders for the championship. As it turned out, the strong play of Duncan and Tony Parker were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4–1 defeat by Dallas, and the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2000. On 31 October 2009, in a game against the Sacramento Kings, a bat descended onto the court at the AT&T Center, causing a stoppage of play. As the bat flew past, Ginóbili swatted the bat to the ground with his hand. He then carried the creature off the court, earning the applause of the crowd. On 9 April 2010, the Spurs and Ginóbili agreed to a three-year, $39 million contract extension through the 2012–13 season.

He returned to the action on 5 March after missing 12 games with the injury, scoring 22 points in 15 minutes against the Sacramento Kings. On 14 July 2016, Ginóbili re-signed with the Spurs. On 9 November, in a loss to the Houston Rockets, Ginóbili became the 15th second-rounder to reach 13,000 points and joined Rashard Lewis as the only second round draft picks in NBA history with 13,000 career points and at least 1,300 three-pointers. In Game 5 of the 2017 Western Conference Semifinals against Houston, Ginóbili blocked James Harden's shot in the closing seconds to help San Antonio to a 110–107 victory. In Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals against Golden State Warriors, Ginóbili became the first player at the age of 39 to score 20 or more points off the bench in a playoff game since the NBA began recording starts in the 1970–71 NBA season. On 24 August 2017, Ginóbili re-signed with the Spurs. In January 2018, he became the only player in NBA history to have multiple 20-point games off the bench at age 40 or older. Ginóbili also became the first player in his 40s to score 15-plus points in back-to-back games since Michael Jordan in 2002–03. On 28 January against the Sacramento Kings, Ginóbili and Vince Carter scored 21 and 15 points respectively; it was the first game in NBA history where two players over the age of 40 scored 15 points or more. On 29 March, in a 103–99 victory over the Thunder, Ginobili became the Spurs' career leader in steals, passing David Robinson (1,388) for the franchise record. In Game 4 of the Spurs' first round playoff series against the Warriors, Ginóbili played in his 217th playoff game, breaking a tie with Shaquille O'Neal for sixth in league history. Ginóbili also passed Reggie Miller for third in career 3-pointers in playoff history. The Spurs lost to the Warriors in five games. = On 27 August 2018, Ginóbili announced his retirement from professional basketball, making him the second player that season to complete a career with one team, after Nick Collison of the Oklahoma City Thunder. On 28 March 2019, the Spurs retired Ginóbili's No. 20 jersey."", ""Ginobili was injured in the last game of the regular season. Despite the injury, he averaged 20.6 points and 4.2 assists during the team's first-round series against Memphis Grizzlies; however, the Spurs lost the series in six games. Ginóbili was named an NBA All-Star for the second time in his career and also was named to the All-NBA third team. Later career (2011–2018) In the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, Ginóbili helped the Spurs go 50–16.

He never lived up to the expectations created by his collegiate success and his large contract, and he was considered a draft bust. While Ferry became a reliable role player in the NBA who was known for his three-point shooting, he did not become a regular starter for the Cavaliers until 1996. In the 1995–96 NBA season, Ferry averaged 13.3 points per game. He had only one other season in his career (1996–1997) in which he averaged more than 10 points per game. During Ferry's 10 years in Cleveland, the team made the NBA playoffs six times. Ferry became the team's all-time leader in games played (723 games) before Žydrūnas Ilgauskas surpassed his record on December 2, 2009. = Ferry signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the San Antonio Spurs as a free agent on August 10, 2000.

Ferry was waived by the Pacers and he retired in 2003 with a career average of 7.0 points per game. Over the course of his career, Ferry shot 39.3% from three-point range. From 2003 to 2005, Ferry worked in the Spurs' front office. On June 27, 2005, Ferry became the Cavaliers' eighth general manager. Ferry began his management tenure with the Cavaliers overseeing a series of less-than-optimal transactions. Nonetheless, the team flourished with superstar LeBron James and newly installed head coach Mike Brown at the helm as the team made a series of serious postseason runs beginning in 2006. Ferry, Brown, and Cavaliers majority owner Dan Gilbert began to add talent and depth to the Cavs' roster, notably acquiring one-time All-Star guard Mo Williams, former All-Star center Shaquille O'Neal, starting shooting guard Anthony Parker, forward Leon Powe, and former All-Star Antawn Jamison between 2008 and 2010.

He was a four-time All-Star. Robertson led the Spurs in steals four of the five seasons he was with the club, three times averaging more than three per game. Though he played only five seasons in San Antonio, he ranks third in club history in total steals, with 1,129. During his San Antonio days, he also recorded a steal in a then-NBA-record 105 consecutive games; Chris Paul surpassed it by recording a steal in 108 consecutive games from 2007 to 2008. A multi-dimensional player, Robertson is one of only four NBA players to record a quadruple-double (double digits in four statistical categories in a single game) when he registered 20 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals while playing for the Spurs against the Phoenix Suns on February 18, 1986.

He would continue to be a premier defender on the Bucks, leading the league in steal percentage, an advanced metric, each of his three full seasons. He was also voted to the 1991 all-star team, the same season he led the league in steals for the third time in his career. = Robertson finished the 1992–93 NBA season with the Detroit Pistons.

His brother, Ken Robertson, played basketball for Cleveland State University. = Robertson has had a history of off-court problems, during and after his career. He spent a month in jail during the 1990 NBA off-season on domestic assault charges against his then-wife. In August 1997, he pleaded no contest to four misdemeanor charges of abusing a former girlfriend and was sentenced to one year in prison. During the trial he was accused of having kicked in an apartment door while his former girlfriend and her 8-year-old daughter were inside, then taking her wallet and knocking over a television set. Robertson allegedly returned a few hours later and ripped rings off her fingers, tore a watch off her wrist, slashed furniture, damaged clothing and tried to set a fire. Robertson was arrested again in San Antonio in January 2007, on a variety of charges, several related to domestic violence. He was arrested in 2010 on charges of sex trafficking, but was later cleared of all charges after learning the accusations were fabricated.

White scored over 1,000 points in his career. At the time of his graduation in 2012, White was a six-foot combo guard. In February 2023, he was honored as the first-ever Legend Hall of Fame inductee. White was lightly recruited out of high school, receiving no scholarship offers from any four-year institutions. At the time of his high school graduation, which fell about two months before his 18th birthday, White was barely six feet (1.83 m) tall—after growing two inches (5 cm) during his senior year. The only head coach at a four-year school who showed sustained interest in White was Jeff Culver, then the head coach at the Denver campus of Johnson & Wales University, a non-scholarship NAIA member better known for its culinary program. By the time White was preparing to make his college decision, Culver was hired as head coach at NCAA Division II\'s Colorado–Colorado Springs and offered White a room-and-board stipend for his freshman season. Culver only expected White to become a starter late in his college career. He was aware that White\'s father had a late growth spurt in college, and also knew that doctors had projected White to potentially reach 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m). As it turned out, White nearly reached that potential height by the time he enrolled at Colorado–Colorado Springs, falling just 1 inch (2.5 cm) short. With his newfound size and athleticism, White became a star at UCCS, starting every game of his three-year career and left as the school\'s career leader in points (1,912) and assists (343).

Ginóbili\'s statistics improved in all major categories, as he averaged 12.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game. During the 2004 playoffs, the Spurs lost again to the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semifinals. Following Game 5 where Derek Fisher scored a buzzer-beating jump shot, the Spurs lost Game 6 and the series 4–2.

The contract had $5 million in bonuses and a player option for the sixth year. Early on in the year, Iguodala was on a Sixers team with high expectations after signing All-Star forward Elton Brand and seeing the success of forward Thaddeus Young, whom they drafted with their lottery pick the prior year. Iguodala developed into more of a primary player in the 2008–09 season, becoming more active as a facilitator on the offensive end of the floor. Early into the season, Philadelphia was struggling, which led to the departure of head coach Maurice Cheeks. The 76ers played much better basketball under interim head coach Tony DiLeo. In his last year with co-captain and veteran point guard Andre Miller, Iguodala helped lead the 76ers to another playoff berth, finishing the season with a 41–41 season record and as the #6-seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs the 76ers were set to face the third seed Orlando Magic.

The Sixers hired coach Eddie Jordan to take over for Tony DiLeo. Iguodala averaged career-highs in rebounds, assists, and blocks, and a career-low in personal fouls. He finished the season averaging 17.1 points, 6.5 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 1.7 steals. However, the 76ers were a big disappointment, going only 27–55 during the regular season and missing the playoffs after two straight playoff berths. During the season, the 76ers brought Iguodala's old friend Allen Iverson back in what would be his final season in the NBA before going to play overseas for Beşiktaş. 2010–11 season: All-Defensive Second Team Coming into the 2010–11 NBA season, the 76ers were expected to rebound from their poor season.

From 1976 to 1984, Turner took a hiatus from politics, working as a corporate lawyer on Bay Street. Trudeau\'s resignation in 1984 triggered a leadership election, which Turner successfully contested. When he was sworn in as prime minister after winning the leadership election, Turner was not an MP or senator — the last time this would occur until Mark Carney in 2025. Turner held the office of prime minister for just 79 days, as he advised the governor general to dissolve Parliament soon after being sworn in. He went on to lose the 1984 election in a landslide to Brian Mulroney\'s Progressive Conservatives, leading the Liberals to the second-worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level (in terms of proportion of seats). Turner stayed on as Liberal leader and led the Opposition for the next six years. In the 1988 election, he vigorously campaigned against Mulroney\'s proposed free trade agreement with the United States, and led the Liberals to a modest recovery. Turner resigned as party leader in 1990 and did not seek re-election as an MP in 1993. Turner was Canada\'s first prime minister born in the United Kingdom since Mackenzie Bowell in 1896, Canada\'s second shortest-serving prime minister behind Charles Tupper, and Canada\'s fourth longest-lived prime minister, living to the age of 91. Turner was born on June 7, 1929, in Richmond, Surrey, England (now a part of London), to Leonard Hugh Turner, an English journalist with the Manchester Guardian, and Phyllis Gregory, a Canadian economist. He had a brother, Michael, born in 1930 (who died shortly after birth), and a sister, Brenda, born in 1931. When Turner\'s father died in 1932, he and his sister moved to Canada with their Canadian-born mother. The family settled in her childhood home in Rossland, British Columbia, and later moved to Ottawa. Turner\'s mother was loving but demanding of her two children. The family was not wealthy. His mother remarried in 1945 to Frank Mackenzie Ross, who later served as Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, and the family relocated to Vancouver. = Turner was educated at Ashbury College and St Patrick\'s College, Ottawa (senior matriculation). He enrolled at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 1945 at age 16 where he was a member of the UBC chapter of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, and was among Canada\'s outstanding track sprinters in the late 1940s. He held the Canadian record for the men\'s 100-yard dash and qualified for the 1948 London Olympics, but a bad knee kept him from competing. He graduated from UBC with a BA (Honours) in 1949. Awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, Turner went on to Magdalen College at the University of Oxford, where he earned a BA in jurisprudence in 1951, and a BCL in 1952; his BA was promoted to an MA per tradition in 1957. He was on the track and field team at Oxford. One of his teammates was Roger Bannister, who became the first runner to break the four-minute barrier in the mile. At Oxford, Turner was a classmate and friend of future Australian Prime Ministers Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke, as well as Jeremy Thorpe, future leader of Britain\'s Liberal Party. He also pursued doctoral studies at the University of Paris from 1952 to 1953. = On July 25, 1958, a ball was hosted by Turner\'s mother and stepfather (in the latter\'s role of Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia), in honour of Princess Margaret at HMCS Discovery, the Canadian navy\'s land station in Vancouver. Turner danced with Princess Margaret, one year his junior, and they sat out talking, refusing requests to return to supper. This was the first time that Turner received significant press attention in Canada. Further meetings between them during Margaret\'s three week official visit to Canada led to considerable speculation about whether the two would become a serious couple. Contemporary press reports suggested there was some consternation about the reports among British officials, but their Canadian counterparts were more relaxed. A year later, in September 1959, press attention returned when reports circulated that Turner had been a recent guest at Balmoral in August where discussions had taken place concerning marriage between the pair; that he had also paid a secret visit to see her in April and that his parents had commented on their close friendship during their visit to Scotland in August. According to letters discovered in 2015, written by Margaret to her friend Sharman Douglas and obtained by the Daily Mail, the relationship was more serious than previously thought with the princess writing in one letter, seven years later: ""John Turner is here & we meet on Thursday. It will seem so funny as we haven\'t met since I nearly married him & he\'s bringing his wife!"". Turner told the Daily Mail: ""I have never talked about it, and I am not going to start talking about it now"". Brenda confirmed a ""very definite attraction"" between her brother and the princess, but said that Turner was uninterested in royalty and would not have given up Catholicism. It has been claimed Turner attended Margaret\'s party at Balmoral Castle in August 1959 where his roommate was Margaret\'s future husband Antony Armstrong-Jones; however, according to his authorized biography, Armstrong-Jones visited Balmoral for the first time in early October 1959. Turner was the only Canadian unofficial guest at their wedding in May 1960. Turner remained friends with Margaret, he and his wife often meeting the princess in Britain or during official visits to Canada. They attended Margaret\'s 2002 private funeral and were Canada\'s official representatives at the memorial service. = Turner was married on May 11, 1963, to Geills McCrae Kilgour (b. 1937) who was then a systems engineer with IBM, and the great niece of Canadian Army doctor John McCrae, the author of what is probably the best-known First World War poem, ""In Flanders Fields"", and sister of David Kilgour, a long-time Canadian Member of Parliament. The Turners have a daughter named Elizabeth and two sons: Michael and Andrew. Their second son, David, died in 2021. The Turner children attended Rockcliffe Park Public School, in Ottawa. All three sons attended Upper Canada College, in Toronto. Turner practised law, initially with the firm of Stikeman Elliott in Montreal, Quebec. He was elected as Member of Parliament for St.', 'In 2013, Turner was named television color commentator for the Magic. Turner starred as a college player for Vanderbilt University. He was selected by the New Jersey Nets with the 17th pick of the 1984 NBA draft. Turner was a member of the Gold Medal 1984 U.S. Olympic basketball team coached by Bobby Knight. The team included Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Wayman Tisdale and Chris Mullin. Turner also played for the US national team in the 1982 FIBA World Championship, winning the silver medal. On June 4, 2008, the Associated Press reported that Ronnie Craven of Somerville, Massachusetts, had been posing as Turner and using the identity to facilitate sexual encounters with women he met in online chat rooms. His ruse also included the additional falsehood that ""Jeff Turner"" was employed in the front office of the Seattle SuperSonics (Turner has never worked for the Sonics). Craven says he has received a cease-and-desist order from a lawyer for the Sonics. Craven said he was embarrassed and would stop lying about his identity.

There’s no way I lose"". On July 9, Jackson\'s investigator, Anthony Pellicano, met Jordan, who denied any abuse or inappropriate touching by Jackson. Evan Chandler\'s lawyer would later call Beverly Hills psychiatrist Dr. Mathis Abrams and present him with a hypothetical situation. In reply and without having met either Jordan Chandler or his parents, Abrams sent Rothman a two-page letter in which he states that ""reasonable suspicion would exist that sexual abuse may have occurred"" after receiving the letter from Dr Abrams Evan Chandler allegedly received a confession from his son Jordan. Evan demands $20 million from Jackson on August 4, 1993, without going to law enforcement regarding the reports of the abuse that was claimed to have taken place, but Jackson refused and sued Chandler for extortion. Later a meeting at the Westwood Marquis Hotel, Evan and his son Jordan met Michael Jackson and Anthony Pellicano without their lawyer Barry Rothman, Evan greeted Jackson with a hug before pulling out a letter from Dr. Mathis Abrams and reading its allegations of child molestation aloud, As Evan cited the molestation references, Jordan lowered his head and then looked at Jackson with evident surprise, casting doubt on the claims as he had reportedly already reported his confession weeks prior. The encounter concluded with Evan pointing at Jackson and declaring, ""I\'m going to ruin you,"" revealing a clear intent to threaten rather than seek justice—a stark contrast to the embrace that opened the meeting. From August 9–13, 1993 Evan Chandler and his legal team made various counteroffers to secure a settlement from Jackson, escalating their financial demands after his refusal to pay the initial $20 million, with Evan later filing a civil suit in September demanding $30 million for alleged damages which were all denied by Jackson, prompting Chandler to go public with the claims of child molestation. Jackson\'s older sister La Toya accused him of being a pedophile; she later retracted this, saying she had been forced into it by her abusive husband. Prosecutors raided Neverland Ranch and other places of residency while Jackson was on tour in August, but no leads were found as the investigators ruled that there was no medical evidence or physical evidence. Additionally hundreds of children were investigated but all of them stated no abuse or improper behavior had taken place. Attention was later brought to two legal art books depicting featuring young boys playing, running, and swimming in various states of undress, however Jackson denied knowing of the books\' content and claimed if they were there, someone had to have sent them to him and he did not open them. No child pornography or other incriminating evidence was found. In December 1993, Prosecutor Tom Sneddon filed a strip search on Jackson based on the drawing obtained by Jordan Chandler which had been sent to the authorities, however the drawing did not match and prosecutors sought out Jackson\'s doctors and family inquiring about the possibility the singer had altered his genitals as to explain the mismatch. In November 1993, Jackson requested that the civil trial be postponed until after the criminal hearing was completed due to a violation of his civil rights, under the circumstances of having to defend himself under double jeopardy. This motion was denied and in January 1994 the civil lawsuit was settled for $15,331,250 with separate payments of 1.5 million for Evan and June Chandler coming out to a total of 18.3 million allocated to the Chandler family, lower than the initial demand of 20-30 million requested by Evan Chandler. The document shows that the Chandlers dropped the child molestation allegations from their complaint with Jackson\'s settlement being filed over claims of negligence. It was later revealed that this settlement did not prevent the Chandlers from testifying in the criminal case The police never pressed criminal charges. The prosecution continued to investigate Jackson from January to June 1994 with Jordan Chandler continuing to co-operate with investigators, by July 1994 multiple grand juries had been called however jurors remarked that no damaging evidence was heard against Jackson. ""The [Santa Barbara] grand jury in Michael Jackson\'s case was dismissed and one juror said he heard no evidence against [Jackson]... Another juror told CNN that he heard no evidence against him [Jackson] during the hearing."" On September 21, 1994, after 400 witnesses had been investigated with another 30 called in front of the grand juries, the investigation was closed. A few potential leads had been found but all of them turned out to be false. Jackson had been taking painkillers for his reconstructive scalp surgeries, administered due to the Pepsi commercial accident in 1984, and became dependent on them to cope with the stress of the sexual abuse allegations. On November 12, 1993, Jackson canceled the remainder of the Dangerous World Tour due to health problems, stress from the allegations and painkiller addiction. He thanked his close friend Elizabeth Taylor for support, encouragement and counsel. The end of the tour concluded his sponsorship deal with Pepsi. In late 1993, Jackson proposed to Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of Elvis Presley, over the phone. They were married in La Vega, Dominican Republic, in May 1994 by civil judge Hugo Francisco Álvarez Pérez. The tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a publicity stunt to deflect away from Jackson\'s sexual abuse allegations and jump-start Presley\'s career as a singer. Their marriage ended little more than a year later, and they separated in December 1995. Presley cited ""irreconcilable differences"" when filing for divorce the next month and only sought to reclaim her maiden name as her settlement. After the divorce, Judge Pérez said, ""They lasted longer than I thought they would. I gave them a year. They lasted a year and a half."" Presley later said she and Jackson had attempted to reconcile intermittently for four years following their divorce, and that she had traveled the world to be with him. Jackson composed music for the Sega Genesis video game Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994), but left the project around the time the sexual abuse allegations surfaced and went uncredited. Jackson\'s involvement was the subject of fan speculation for decades until Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka confirmed it in 2022. Sega Technical Institute director Roger Hector and Sonic co-creator Naoto Ohshima said that Jackson was terminated and his music reworked following the allegations. However, Jackson\'s musical director Brad Buxer and other members of Jackson\'s team said he went uncredited because he was unhappy with how the Genesis replicated his music. The game\'s credits theme served as the basis for Jackson\'s 1996 song ""Stranger in Moscow"". = In June 1995, Jackson released the double album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. The first disc, HIStory Begins, is a greatest hits album (reissued in 2001 as Greatest Hits: HIStory, Volume I). The second disc, HIStory Continues, contains 13 original songs and two cover versions. The album debuted at number one on the charts and has been certified for eight million shipments in the US. It is the bestselling multi-disc album of all time, with 20 million copies (40 million units) sold worldwide. HIStory received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. The New York Times reviewed it as ""the testimony of a musician whose self-pity now equals his talent"". The first single from HIStory was ""Scream/Childhood"". ""Scream"", a duet with Jackson\'s youngest sister Janet, protests the media\'s treatment of Jackson during the 1993 child abuse allegations against him. The single reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100, and received a Grammy nomination for ""Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals"".', 'Andre Tyler Iguodala ( ig-wə-DAH-lə; born January 28, 1984) is an American former professional basketball player who played for 19 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Paspalj\'s forester father Jovan\'s lumber trade job took him from his home village on the slopes of Kozara in Bosanska Krajina to Pljevlja, finding employment at the Velimir Jakić Lumber Processing Plant (ŠIK Velimir Jakić). Once there he married a local woman, Mileva, and remained. Their first child, son Darko, was born in 1961, five years before Žarko was born in 1966. During the mid-1970s, when young Žarko was ten years old, his father\'s job requirements moved the family to Titograd. Žarko took up basketball and soon established himself in the youth system of KK Budućnost. He considers himself an ethnic Serb from Montenegro, which he believes is ""only natural"". = Paspalj began his career in 1982. At 16 he moved up to Budućnost\'s first team where he was part of a talented generation alongside Zdravko Radulović and Luka Pavićević. At the time, Budućnost was a small, unambitious side that had played its first ever top-tier season two years earlier in 1980–81, essentially serving as talent feeder for bigger Yugoslav League clubs like Partizan, Cibona, Jugoplastika, Crvena zvezda, and Bosna. Not too long after that, Paspalj entered the senior squad. Playing under young head coach Milutin Petrović and alongside seasoned Yugoslav League players such as Nikola Antić and the Ivanović brothers (Duško and Dragan), the talented youngster contributed greatly to Budućnost\'s third place league finish in the 1985–86 season and a playoff semi-final where they lost to eventual champions Zadar. = During the summer of 1986 Budućnost sold 20-year-old Paspalj to Partizan. Eighteen-year-old Vlade Divac, another rising star, also joined the club that summer from Sloga. Together with young Sasha Djordjevic, Željko Obradović and more established players like Milenko Savović and Goran Grbović, they won the national title in a final against Crvena zvezda. Paspalj played well enough to earn a spot on the national team of Yugoslavia that won bronze at the EuroBasket 1987 in Athens, Greece. The following year, in 1988, he played a leading role in the side that made it to the Olympic final against the Soviet Union, and marked himself out as a potential star with some fine performances for Yugoslavia at the 1988 McDonald\'s Open. Also in 1988, Paspalj top-scored for Yugoslavia at the prestigious Acropolis Tournament in Athens, which included 26 points in one half in a tough-fought 104–103 victory against US college side Duke. = In the summer of 1989, Paspalj became one of the first Europeans to move to the NBA, joining the San Antonio Spurs despite going undrafted one year earlier. He came into the league alongside two Soviets (Šarūnas Marčiulionis and Alexander Volkov) and two more fellow Yugoslavs (Dražen Petrović and Vlade Divac) as they were collectively dubbed the ""green card five"" by Sports Illustrated. At the time they were the only five players in the entire NBA who didn\'t come up through the American collegiate system.', 'Beginning in 2007, Danilović served as the president of Partizan, the club with which he spent six years as a player during the 1980s and early 1990s. In 2015, he resigned from the position. On December 15, 2016, Danilović became the president of the Basketball Federation of Serbia (KSS). Born in Sarajevo to a family of Herzegovinian Serbs (father Milan from the Orašje Zubci village near Trebinje and mother Vuka from the Kukričje village near Bileća), Danilović grew up in the Alipašino polje neighbourhood near the RTV Sarajevo main building. Many of his childhood summers and winters were spent in the villages of his father and mother, and in the town of Trebinje where he had aunts and uncles. A tall and lanky kid, Danilović excelled at a variety of sports, including football, speed skating, and street basketball. Already showing promise at streetball, in 1984, the fourteen-year-old began playing organized basketball in KK Bosna\'s youth setup under youth coach Mladen ""Makso"" Ostojić. The player\'s talent was immediately evident and it didn\'t take long before he started receiving attention from bigger Yugoslav clubs such as KK Partizan whose assistant coach Duško Vujošević was alerted to the youngster\'s talents by the team\'s point guard Željko Obradović who had spotted Danilović during summer 1985 at a Yugoslav intra-republic youth basketball tournament on Mount Zlatibor. Young Danilović played for a select team of players representing SR Bosnia-Herzegovina at the tournament. By late 1985, Vujošević started courting the fifteen-year-old. Getting Danilović and his parents to agree to a move to Belgrade proved to be the easy part; the real challenge was getting his club KK Bosna to sign off on the transfer. Danilović wasn\'t under a professional contract with the Sarajevo club, however, according to Yugoslav Basketball Federation (KSJ) rules, being a youth system prospect, he needed his club\'s permission to complete the move. In Danilović\'s own words: ""Bosna club management weren\'t too keen on me at all while I was there; they had even been planning to loan me out to other Sarajevo-area clubs, which I didn\'t want at all. But then Vujošević started sniffing around, and they suddenly wanted to keep me. Also, Bosna club president Mirza Delibašić and Partizan vice-president Dragan Kićanović were close friends going back to their playing days, so that created additional awkwardness and the whole thing dragged out for a while"". Since Bosna didn\'t want to let him go, by the summer of \'86 Danilović and Partizan decided to act unilaterally to move the player to Belgrade, knowing full well he\'d have to sit out a year before taking part in official competitions. The move marked the beginning of a long friendship and professional association between Danilović and Vujošević, with the twenty-eight-year-old coach initially acting as a mentor to the sixteen-year-old player. By December 1986 Vujošević had moved up in the Partizan club hierarchy, becoming head coach in place of the fired Vladislav Lučić while young Danilović trained by himself and with the first team. Due to the unfortunate administrative situation, Danilović could only practice with Partizan players, which he did vigorously and assiduously, up to 7 or 8 hours per day. He stated in later interviews that it wasn\'t until his arrival at Partizan that he started training seriously. His living arrangements were provided for by the club; they put him up in a room at the JNA Stadium that he shared with youngster teammates Oliver Popović and Popović\'s brother. Furthermore, in accordance with his parents\' wishes, the club ensured he also pursued his full-time secondary education by getting enrolled in the streamlined Petar Drapšin Technical High School. However, unable to make the classes due to frequent, lengthy practices, he soon switched to part-time education at the streamlined touristic high school. Discussing his first days in Belgrade and arrival at a new club, Danilović later said: Certain people at Partizan liked me very much, but there were also those within the club who thought I was a \'neanderthal from Sarajevo\' because I was a very brazen kid and I practiced like an animal. At that moment, for me, Vujošević was both a coach and a father.', 'I\'ll stick around for a while!"". He compared the decision to Spielberg\'s father Arnold, who had worked in his field until he was 100. = Spielberg recommended Williams to his friend George Lucas, who needed a composer for his space opera Star Wars (1977). Williams delivered a grand symphonic score influenced by Gustav Holst\'s orchestral suite The Planets, as well as Richard Strauss, Antonín Dvořák, and Golden Age Hollywood composers Max Steiner and Erich Wolfgang Korngold. The Star Wars theme is among the most widely recognized in film history, and the ""Force Theme"" and ""Princess Leia\'s Theme"" are well-known examples of leitmotif. The score was immensely successful—it remains the highest grossing non-popular music recording of all time—and won Williams a second Academy Award for Best Original Score. In 1980, Williams returned to score The Empire Strikes Back, introducing ""The Imperial March"" as the theme for Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire, ""Yoda\'s Theme"", and ""Han Solo and the Princess"". The original Star Wars trilogy concluded with Return of the Jedi, for which Williams provided the ""Emperor\'s Theme"", ""Parade of the Ewoks"", and ""Luke and Leia"". Both scores earned him Academy Award nominations. In 1999, Lucas launched the first of three prequels to the original Star Wars trilogy. Williams was asked to score all three, starting with The Phantom Menace. Along with themes from the previous films, Williams created new themes for 2002\'s Attack of the Clones and 2005\'s Revenge of the Sith. Most notable of these was ""Duel of the Fates"", an aggressive choral composition in the style of Verdi\'s Requiem, using harsh Sanskrit lyrics that broadened the style of music used in the Star Wars films. It used vocal melodies instead of his usual compositions using brass instruments. Also of note was ""Anakin\'s Theme"", which begins as an innocent childlike melody and morphs insidiously into a quote of the sinister ""Imperial March"". For Attack of the Clones, Williams composed ""Across the Stars"", a love theme for Padmé Amidala and Anakin Skywalker (mirroring the love theme composed for The Empire Strikes Back). The final installment Revenge of the Sith combined many of the themes created for the series\' previous films, including ""The Emperor\'s Theme"", ""The Imperial March"", ""Across the Stars"", ""Duel of the Fates"", ""The Force Theme"", ""Rebel Fanfare"", ""Luke\'s Theme"", and ""Princess Leia\'s Theme"", as well as new themes for General Grievous and the film\'s climax, titled ""Battle of the Heroes"". Williams scored the first three film adaptations of J.', 'During Danilović\'s layoff, the Heat completely overhauled their roster including their early-season starting lineup. On February 23, 1996, the team made three trades on the same day, bringing in Tim Hardaway and Chris Gatling from Golden State for Bimbo Coles and Kevin Willis, then getting Walt Williams and Tyrone Corbin from Sacramento for Billy Owens and Kevin Gamble, and finally acquiring Tony Smith from Phoenix for Terrence Rencher. The projections of Danilović\' return from injury at the beginning of April 1996 proved overly optimistic as he came bacķ a bit later - on April 21, 1996, at home versus Atlanta, the Heat\'s last game of the regular season. Very rusty after four months on the sidelines during which he missed 62 games, Danilović, who had in the meantime also lost his starting spot to Rex Chapman, put up a modest 8 points during 25 minutes of action off the bench on 3 for 9 shooting from the field that included airballing his first shot back after the injury layoff and coming up well short on his first 3-point shot as Miami lost 92–104. The Heat ended the season with 42–40 record, qualifying for the playoffs as the eighth-placed team in the Eastern Conference where they would face the juggernaut Michael Jordan\'s Chicago Bulls team that had lost only 10 games the entire season. Making his NBA playoff debut only five days after coming back from months-long injury layoff, Danilović started on the bench as coach Riley retained Chapman as his starting shooting guard. The Serb had another poor post-injury outing, scoring only 3 points in 22 minutes on 1 for 3 from the field as Miami got blown out 102–85 by the Bulls. Two days later, game two of the series brought a much improved performance by Danilović who scored a team-high 15 points off the bench in 23 minutes; however, the Heat suffered an even worse blowout, this time by 31 points. The series then shifted to Miami, and the rampant Bulls converted on their first opportunity to end the series, beating the Heat easily for the third time in a row, 112–91, as Danilović, playing reduced minutes, scored 7 points. = In early June 1997, after getting offered a US$6 million net income three-year contract from his old club Virtus, Danilović decided to end his time in the NBA, two years short of completing his 4-year contract, thus forfeiting $4.9 million in NBA salary. On April 23, 1998, Danilović won his second EuroLeague, defeating AEK in Barcelona. While on May 31, Virtus took its 14th national title in five games against Teamsystem Bologna. With 20 seconds to go anad Fortitudo leading by 4, Danilović made a three-point shot while being fouled by Dominique Wilkins, completing a four point play. Than Virtus went on to win the game in overtime. The 1998 final between Virtus and Fortitudo is widely considered the greatest in the history of Italian basketball, with two of the teams on the continent playing in the same city. The following season, Virtus won its 7th Italian Cup but lost in the EuroLeague final against Žalgiris of Tyus Edney and was eliminated in the semi-finals for the national championship. Under Cazzola\'s presidency and thanks to the leadership of Danilović and coach Messina, the 1990s were considered Virtus\' ""Golden Age"" with four national titles, two Italian Cups, a Cup Winners\' Cup and a EuroLeague, making them one of the most high-profile and successful teams in Europe. At the end of the following season, in October 2000, Danilović surprised many by announcing his retirement from professional basketball. = With the senior Yugoslav national basketball team, Danilović won the gold medal at both the 1989 EuroBasket and the 1991 EuroBasket. With the senior FR Yugoslav national basketball team, he won the gold medal at both the 1995 EuroBasket and the 1997 EuroBasket. He was also a member of the silver medal-winning FR Yugoslav team at the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics. EuroLeague: 2 (with Partizan: 1991–92 and Virtus Bologna: 1997–98) Korać Cup: 1 (with Partizan: 1988–89) Yugoslav Cup: 1 (with Partizan: 1988–89, 1991–92) Yugoslav League: 1 (with Partizan: 1991–92) Yugoslav Cup: 1 (with Partizan: 1991–92) Italian League: 4 (with Virtus Bologna: 1992–93, 1993–94, 1994–95, 1997–98) Italian Cup: 1 (with Virtus Bologna: 1998–99) = In October 2000, shortly after retiring from playing professionally, Danilović became co-vice president of his old club KK Partizan alongside Žarko Paspalj, Dražen Dalipagić, and Ivica Divac, working under the also newly named club president Vlade Divac. The appointment came about on initiative by the club\'s about to be deposed president Ivica Dačić during the time of political upheaval in Serbia in the wake of the Slobodan Milošević overthrow. Seeing that various state-owned companies and community property were being taken over in a dubious manner during the power vacuum that resulted from régime change, Dačić (the club\'s outgoing president and, more importantly, a suddenly marginalized politician who, due to his association with Milošević, was forced to leave his post at the club) saw it prudent to bring the club\'s two former greats as a safeguard against the same happening to KK Partizan. Since club president Divac was at the time still an active player in the NBA with Sacramento Kings, while nominal co-vice presidents Paspalj, Dalipagić, and Ivica Divac exhibited little interest in being involved in the club\'s day-to-day business, Danilović essentially became the main decision-maker at KK Partizan. Inheriting a head coach, Darko Russo, Danilović let him finish out the season before hiring old mentor and friend Duško Vujošević during summer 2001. Vujošević immediately started producing results, winning the league title in 2001–02, ending KK Budućnost\'s three-year league championship run. It was the first of nine consecutive league trophies under his command. Though continually cash-strapped, under the command of Danilović, Divac, and sporting director Dragan Todorić, the club instituted a model of bringing up domestic young players from its own youth setup or smaller clubs in Serbia and Montenegro rather than relying on foreign imports. It proved a winner both on the court and business-wise as Partizan sold its best player in regular intervals (usually every summer) and then re-invested that money into the youth system or acquiring talented youngsters from smaller clubs while making sure that squad can function with other players stepping up. Under this model, in summer 2003 Miloš Vujanić was sold to Fortitudo Bologna while the following summer 2004 Nenad Krstić got sold to New Jersey Nets. The club managed to win the domestic league FR Yugoslavia/Serbia-Montenegro league year after year, ensuring a EuroLeague spot, which was essential for its bottom line. Simultaneously, Danilović was very much against his club joining the regional Adriatic League. However, by 2004, Partizan was essentially forced into the regional competition because its Euroleague spot now depended on competing regionally rather than domestically. This also brought about change in the club\'s business model as in the summer of 2004 they brought in already established national team players 27-year-old Dejan Milojević from KK Budućnost and 29-year-old Milan Gurović from KK Vojvodina to bolster the squad ahead of the start of competition in Adriatic League. It would prove to be one of Danilović\'s last orders of business at the club as he soon left KK Partizan. = In 2007 Danilović returned to KK Partizan, this time as president. In late May 2007, following a Serbian Basketball League game from the SuperLeague phase, between KK Hemofarm and Partizan at Vršac\'s Millennium Centar, Danilović assaulted the referee Marko Juras. Dissatisfied over Juras\' calls in the game that Partizan lost, thirty-seven-year-old KK Partizan president reportedly followed the twenty-nine-year-old referee into the referees\' dressing room and proceeded to knock him to the floor, landing several punches. Juras filed a criminal complaint against Danilović as did the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs. In July 2007, Danilović got suspended by the Serbian Basketball Federation (KSS) from all basketball-related activity for two years, but two months later the punishment was reduced to a probationary period. On August 24, 2015, he resigned from the president\'s position, after few years of financial troubles the club was going through. = On December 15, 2016, Danilović became the president of the Basketball Federation of Serbia (KSS). On December 14, 2020, he was re-elected. Danilović is married to Svetlana Danilović, an RTS sports reporter. The couple have three children, including Olga, a professional tennis player. He was also involved with Group Seven, a charity organization founded by seven Serbian basketball players. On February 11, 2009, Danilović filed a lawsuit against Worldwide Associates (a limited-liability company based in Carmel, Indiana and represented by Rick Suder and George Grkinich) alleging investment fraud connected to $4 million he gave the company to manage. Previously, Grkinich had also been involved with Group Seven. = In the early morning hours of Saturday, May 18, 2013, forty-three-year-old Danilović was stabbed during a bar brawl in Belgrade, sustaining injuries to his head, arms, and abdomen, for which he underwent surgery at Belgrade\'s Urgentni centar. From the press reports, KK Partizan club president Danilović had been drinking and eating at the Kafanica bar, a kafana-type hospitality establishment in the Košutnjak neighbourhood, together with a party of friends including the bar\'s owner—Danilović\'s close friend, Branko ""Fido"" Filipović—before an altercation broke out around 2:20 am between Filipović and Danilović. Filipović reportedly struck Danilović in the head with an ashtray prompting someone from the bar to call an ambulance, which Danilović refused upon their arrival, sending them away. The fight between the two continued with Filipović now stabbing Danilović in the abdomen, and injured Danilović driving by himself to the hospital. Due to the nature of his injuries, considered ""life-threatening"", Danilović underwent emergency surgery before being placed in intensive care in stable condition. During the day Danilović was visited at the hospital by the Serbian prime minister Ivica Dačić (incidentally Danilović\'s personal friend and predecessor at the KK Partizan club president post), deputy prime minister Aleksandar Vučić and sports minister Alisa Marić. Talking to the press afterwards, prime minister Dačić jokingly described the circumstances of Danilović\'s stabbing as ""traditional Serbian quarrel between friends"". On May 20, 2013, after unsuccessfully trying to summon Branko Filipović for questioning, Serbian police issued a warrant for his arrest. Danilović was released from the hospital on May 26, 2013 and was then seen in public at the Belgrade Airport awaiting the arrival of Jovica Stanišić and Franko Simatović, who had been acquitted at the Hague Tribunal. After being on the run for more than two weeks, Filipović was arrested in Belgrade on June 2, 2013. Though initially charging Filipović with ""causing severe bodily harm with life-threatening injuries"", the Serbian public prosecutor\'s office later upgraded his charge to ""attempted murder"". During the trial, the role of Filipović\'s fiancée Sanja Ševović (who had been present at the bar the night of the stabbing) came under scrutiny, particularly the exact time she claimed to have left the bar. In February 2014, Filipović was sentenced in the Belgrade Higher Court to 4+1⁄2 years in prison for the attempted murder of Danilović. Having already spent nine months in prison detention, Filipović was released on the same occasion thus awaiting the sentence becoming legally-binding upon the completion of the appeals process for him to commence his jail time. The case was appealed and, in May 2015, the Court of Appeals annulled the lower court sentence, ordering a re-trial. Initially set for late August 2015, the re-trial began in mid-October 2015. Following court dates throughout 2016, 2017, and 2018, in early May 2018 Filipović and the Serbian public prosecutor office reportedly reached an admission of guilt agreement awaiting the Higher Court confirmation.', 'He lived there because his father was playing professional handball locally with the Ascoli Piceno Handball. After that, he trained for two years in Nova Varoš. In 2005, he moved to Crvena zvezda at the age of 15. He had success in the junior competition, as in 2008 when he became champion with the junior team of Crvena zvezda. After that, he moved to the first team where he finally made a breakthrough professionally.', 'They were thus followed on both sides of the Atlantic with extra interest as the public was curious to see how foreigners fare in the world\'s best league. Paspalj came to the Spurs courtesy of the team\'s assistant coach Gregg Popovich who noticed the 23-year-old small forward at a warm-up tournament in Dortmund, West Germany in early June 1989 where the Yugoslav national team had been preparing for EuroBasket 1989 later that month. Liking Paspalj\'s game, Popovich established initial contact with the player through Paspalj\'s national squad training camp teammate Zoran Jovanović who spoke English having played college ball at Louisiana State. When approached by Popovich about coming to the Spurs, Paspalj immediately expressed interest despite openly admitting to never actually believing anything would come of it as the notion of playing basketball in the NBA seemed vague and far fetched to him. Immediately following the EuroBasket championship—where Yugoslavia won gold in dominating fashion with Paspalj making the All-Tournament Team by contributing 13.4 points per game over five games, all of them blowout wins for the rampant Yugoslavs—the player was even quoted in Yugoslav press rubbishing the idea of going to the NBA while announcing intention of completing his mandatory Yugoslav People\'s Army (JNA) service before finishing his contract with Partizan and only then transferring abroad to either Italian or Spanish league. Nevertheless, the Spurs acquisition was agreed within weeks with Paspalj on summer vacation in Budva and Popovich reaching out with a US$350,000 gross sum offer for a one-year contract with options to extend afterwards. Basketball player Nebojša Bukumirović, another former NCAA player, also participated as an operational liaison in the subsequent transfer process from Partizan to San Antonio. Still, Paspalj\'s transfer was not without procedural issues stemming from the fact NBA teams did not pay transfer fees for European players under contract with clubs in Europe, treating their entry into the league within the same legal framework as American collegiate players turning professional. Any transfer fee compensation to European clubs for releasing a player early from his contractual obligations thus fell on the player himself. In Paspalj\'s case, due to still being under contract with Partizan, the club wanted him to pay US$50,000 for the release but the player refused, claiming supposed earlier unmet stipulations from his contract. Even the club\'s outgoing head coach Duško Vujošević—himself on his way out of the club—got involved, reportedly counselling Paspalj privately to pay the fee by reasoning that it\'s ""unbecoming of the best forward in Europe to leave his club this way"". In the end, the player chose not to pay the fee; instead accepting an agreement whereby KK Partizan retained his rights should he return to Europe. In 2015, Paspalj recalled his final few summer 1989 days in Yugoslavia before setting off for the U.S.: I remember being down in Budva, shooting hoops at Slovenska Beach. It was Luka Pavićević, EuroLeague champion with Jugoplastika, and me, the starting small forward of the EuroBasket-winning national team, playing two-on-two against Slađan Stojković and Aleksa Milošević—and those two were kicking our asses, we couldn\'t score five points on them. So, during a break, I go to Luka: \'Listen, these NBA guys want me. I\'m going to Belgrade the day after tomorrow to pack my stuff and then the following day I\'m off to San Antonio\'. His response was not enthusiastic at all, I mean he used to play college ball in the States, in Utah, so he already knew how basketball things work there.', 'He grew up in a two-bedroom apartment that housed him, his two brothers, parents, and grandmother. He attended primary school ""Dositej Obradović."" His father was an agricultural engineer. Jokić developed a love of basketball early in his life playing with his two older brothers, Strahinja and Nemanja, who were a decade older. Both brothers played basketball in Serbia with Nemanja later playing college basketball for Detroit Mercy and C.W.', 'Dražen Petrović (Croatian pronunciation: [drǎʒen pětroʋitɕ]; 22 October 1964 – 7 June 1993) was a Yugoslav and Croatian professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he initially achieved success playing professional basketball in Europe in the 1980s with Cibona and Real Madrid before joining the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1989. A star on multiple international basketball stages, Petrović earned two silver medals (1988, 1992) and one bronze (1984) at the Summer Olympic Games, a gold (1990) and a bronze (1986) at the FIBA World Cup, and a gold (1989) and a bronze (1987) at the FIBA EuroBasket. He was the FIBA World Championship MVP in 1986 and the FIBA EuroBasket MVP in 1989. With Cibona Zagreb, Petrović also won two consecutive EuroLeague championships in 1985 and 1986. He first represented Yugoslavia\'s senior national team and later Croatia\'s senior national team. He earned four Euroscars and was named Mr. Europa twice. In 1985, he received the Golden Badge award for the best athlete of Yugoslavia. Seeking a bigger arena after his career started in Europe, Petrović joined the NBA in 1989, as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers. After playing mostly off the bench that year, Petrović experienced a breakthrough following a trade to the New Jersey Nets. While starting for the Nets, he became one of the league\'s best shooting guards. He was named one of FIBA\'s 50 Greatest Players in 1991. On 7 June 1993, Petrović\'s career and life were cut short after he died in a car accident in Germany at the age of 28. In 1993, Petrović\'s jersey number 3 was retired by the Nets, and the Dražen Petrović Basketball Hall was named in his honor. He also received the Olympic Order in 1993. In 2002, he was posthumously enshrined into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In 2006, the Dražen Petrović Award was created in his honor. In 2007, he was posthumously inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame. He was named one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors in 2008. In 2013, he was voted the best European Basketball player in history, by players at the 2013 FIBA EuroBasket. Petrović is considered a crucial part of the vanguard to the present-day mass influx of European players into the NBA, and to this day he is viewed as a national hero in Croatia. Born in Šibenik, Yugoslavia (present-day Croatia), Dražen Petrović was the second child of Jovan ""Jole"" Petrović, a police officer, and Biserka (née Mikulandra), a librarian. His father was born in a Serb family in Zagora, near Trebinje in Bosnia and Herzegovina. His mother was born in Bilice, near Šibenik, and was from a traditional conservative Croat family, devoutly Catholic. The couple\'s eldest child, Aleksandar, was the first to play basketball and rose to become one of the top point guards in the former Yugoslavia. The Petrović brothers are second cousins to the Serbian basketball player Dejan Bodiroga. = At the age of 13, Petrović started playing in the youth selections of the local club Šibenka; at the age of 15, he had already made the club\'s first team, just as Šibenka had earned a place in the Yugoslav national first division. With young Petrović as the star of the team, Šibenka reached the final of the third level Pan-European club competition, the FIBA Korać Cup twice (1981–82 and 1982–83), where they lost to the French League club Limoges CSP both times. In 1983, the 18-year-old Petrović hit two free throws in Šibenka\'s victory over Bosna Sarajevo in the final playoff game of the Yugoslavian League\'s 1982–83 season\'s club championship. However, on the day after the club won the championship, the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia stripped the title from Šibenka, because of irregularities in refereeing. The league\'s championship was then awarded to Bosna, after Šibenka refused to play in a rematch. Petrović increased his scoring numbers in each successive season that he played with Šibenka. In the 1979–80 Yugoslav FFL season, he scored 13 points in 16 games, for an average of 0.8 points per game. In the 1980–81 Yugoslav FFL season, he scored 39 points in 20 games, for an average of 2.0 points per game. In the 1981–82 Yugoslav FFL season, he scored 392 points in 24 games, for an average of 16.3 points per game. In the 1982–83 Yugoslav FFL season, he scored 758 points in 31 games, for an average of 24.5 points per game. In total, he scored 1,202 points in 91 games played with Šibenka in the Yugoslav first division, for a scoring average of 13.2 points per game. = 1984–85 season After a year\'s mandatory service in the Yugoslav military, Petrović joined his older brother Aco and moved to Cibona Zagreb, to form what was at that time, the best back court duo in Europe. In his first season in Cibona, Petrović won both the national Yugoslav League championship and the Yugoslav National Cup title. In national domestic league play, in the 1984–85 Yugoslav FFL season, Petrović averaged 32.5 points per game. On 6 December 1984, in the 1984–85 season of Europe\'s top-level club competition, the FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague), Petrović scored 44 points in a game against the Spanish League club Real Madrid. He scored 29 of the 44 points in the second half of the game. Petrović also scored 36 points in the league\'s 1985 Final against Real Madrid. Cibona won the game, by a score of 87–78, and the win brought the club their first top-tier level European Champions Cup title. That season, Petrović scored a total of 463 points in 15 games played, for a scoring average of 30.9 points per game. 1985–86 season On 5 October 1985, in a Yugoslav First Federal League game against Union Olimpija Ljubljana, Petrović scored 112 points, in Cibona\'s 158–77 blowout win. He scored 67 of the 112 points in the first half of the game. During the game, Petrović shot 40/60 from the field, 10/20 from 3-point range, and 22/22 from the free-throw line. The 112 points scored was the most points ever scored in a single game in the history of the Yugoslav First Federal League. It broke the league\'s previous single-game scoring record of 74 points, which was set in 1962, by Radivoj Korać. Korać achieved that record while playing with OKK Beograd, in a game against Mladost Zagreb. Olimpija Ljubljana had failed to fulfill their player registration administrative obligations in time for the game. Olimpija general manager Radovan Lorbek was reportedly late with submitting a registration letter to the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia (KSJ) headquarters in Belgrade. That rendered their entire men\'s first team roster ineligible for the Yugoslav First Federal League\'s regular season opening game, and forced them to instead field players for the game from their youth systems. Olimpija didn\'t have an under-18 youth squad that season so the club went to Zagreb to play the game with younger players. in the under-16 and under-17 age groups, which included: Igor Đurović, Matjaž Strmole, Jože Maček, Dag Kralj, Tine Erjavec, Jure Zorčič, Gregor Stražiščar, Andrej Novina, and Tine Merzelj. Cibona, for their part, decided to use a mixed roster for the game, consisting of players from their youth system, plus their senior men\'s team\'s twenty-one-year-old Dražen Petrović, who broke Korać\'s single-game Yugoslav League scoring record of 74 points. Petrović scored 112 points in the game; before the game, he had reportedly announced his intention to leave the game once he had surpassed Korać\'s 74 points record. Petrović was one of only five Cibona players to score that day. From November 1985, Petrović began partnering in the backcourt with another high-scoring player, newly arrived shooting guard Danko Cvjetićanin, brought in as replacement for Aco Petrović who was away serving his mandatory Yugoslav People\'s Army (JNA) stint. Overall, over the 1985–86 Yugoslav League regular season and playoffs, Petrović scored a total of 1,241 points in 30 games played, for a scoring average of 41.4 points per game. That season, Petrović also won another Yugoslav National Cup title with Cibona. On 7 February 1986, Petrović scored 55 points in a Yugoslav Cup game against Union Olimpija Ljubljana. He also scored 46 points in the 1986 Yugoslav Cup\'s Final against Cibona\'s old rivals Bosna Sarajevo. On 4 December 1985, in a 1985–86 season FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) game against the Israeli Super League club Maccabi Tel Aviv, Petrović scored 44 points. In the same European Champions Cup season, on 11 December 1985, he had 47 points and 25 assists in a game against the then reigning Italian League champions Simac Milano. In another European Champions Cup game that season, on 16 January 1986, Petrović scored 49 points, and had 20 assists against the Spanish League club Real Madrid. On 22 January 1986, in a European Champions Cup game against the French League club Limoges, Petrović made ten 3-pointers, including seven in a row during a first-half stretch, for a final tally of 51 points and 10 assists in the game. The 51 points scored was also his personal career-high scored in a single EuroLeague game. Petrović won his second straight FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) title with Cibona, as he scored 22 points in the league\'s 1986 Final, in which Cibona defeated the USSR Premier League club Žalgiris Kaunas, which starred Arvydas Sabonis. In the 1985–86 European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) season, Petrović scored a total of 555 points in 15 games played, for a scoring average of 37.0 points per game. The season ended with Cibona losing the Yugoslav league playoff final series to KK Zadar. Following an opening game win, Petrović controversially sat out game 2 away in Zadar, ostensibly due to a pre-game warm-up injury, leading to accusations of tanking out of desire to win the title on home court in front of their own fans. Cibona lost game 2 thus setting up the deciding game 3 at home in Zagreb at the sold out Dom sportova. However, in one of the biggest upsets in Yugoslav League history, despite having a double-digit lead in the second half, Cibona ended up losing game 3 in double overtime with Petrović fouling out during first overtime with 39 points scored. 1986–87 season In the 1986–87 Yugoslav FFL season, Petrović scored a total of 932 points in 25 games played, for a scoring average of 37.3 points per game. In that same season, Cibona competed in the European-wide secondary level FIBA European Cup Winners\' Cup competition. Petrović led Cibona to the championship, as he scored 28 points against the Italian League club Scavolini Pesaro, in the league\'s 1986–87 season Final. It was the third straight European-wide club championship for Petrović and Cibona. In the 1986–87 FIBA European Cup Winners Cup season, Petrović scored a total of 270 points in 8 games played, for a scoring average of 33.8 points per game. 1987–88 season With Cibona, Petrović again won the Yugoslav National Cup title in 1988. In the 1987–88 Yugoslav FFL season, Petrović scored a total of 860 points in 24 games played, for a scoring average of 35.8 points per game. In that same season, Cibona competed in Europe\'s third-level club competition, the FIBA Korać Cup. On 14 October 1987, Petrović scored 62 points in a 1987–88 FIBA Korać Cup season game against the Finnish League club KTP Kotka. Petrović led Cibona to the Finals of the Korać Cup, where they lost to the Spanish League club Real Madrid. During the Korać Cup season, Petrović scored a total of 401 points in 12 games played, for a scoring average of 33.4 points per game. During his four seasons with Cibona, Petrović scored a total of 3,911 points, in 106 games played in the national Yugoslav First Federal League, for a scoring average of 36.9 points per game. With Cibona, he also scored a total of 559 points, in 20 games played, for a scoring average of 28.0 points per game, in the Yugoslav Cup competition. In the three Pan-European club competitions that he played in with Cibona, he scored a total of 1,689 points in 50 games played, for a scoring average of 33.8 points per game. With both Šibenka and Cibona, Petrović\'s career scoring numbers in the Yugoslav First Federal League were 5,113 points scored, in 197 games played, for a career scoring average of 26.0 points per game. In the FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague), Petrović scored a career total of 1,018 points in 30 games played, for a career scoring average of 33.9 points per game. = After his string of very successful seasons with Cibona Zagreb, Petrović needed new challenges that Cibona and the Yugoslav First Federal League could no longer offer him. The NBA\'s Portland Trail Blazers had already used their third-round draft pick on the young Petrović, in the 1986 NBA draft, but he had decided to postpone his departure to the United States. In 1988, rather than go to the NBA, he instead signed with the Spanish League club Real Madrid, for around US$4 million in net income. At that time, Yugoslav sporting laws stipulated that players could not professionally move abroad until they had reached the age of 28. Petrović was still only 23 when he signed with Real Madrid. In 2014, José Antonio Arízaga, the sports agent who played a key role in Petrović\'s 1988 summer transfer from Cibona to Real, recalled a few details from the transaction: ""I spoke to Mirko Novosel, Dražen\'s head coach at Cibona, and he told me two things. One, every problem in Yugoslavia can be taken care of with the right amount of money, and two, if Dražen leaves, every other player under 28 will be leaving and it\'ll be chaos. So, you can imagine all the individuals I had to bribe and all the places where I had to pay up, in order to circumvent this law"". 1988–89 season Petrović helped Real to win the title of the 1989 edition of the Spanish King\'s Cup, over their Catalan rivals, Barcelona. In the Spanish ACB League\'s Finals, Real Madrid narrowly lost to Barcelona, in the fifth and decisive game of the series. In the Spanish League\'s 1988–89 ACB season, Petrović was the league\'s regular season top scorer. Including the playoffs, he scored a total of 1,327 points, in 47 games played, for a scoring average of 28.2 points per game. Petrović\'s first season in Spain\'s ACB was also his last, but he still holds the ACB\'s single-game Finals records for the most points scored, with 42, and for the most three-pointers made, with 8. In European-wide club competition, Real Madrid competed in the European secondary level FIBA European Cup Winners\' Cup. On 14 March 1989, in the 1988–89 Cup Winners\' Cup Final against the Italian League club Snaidero Caserta, Petrović tied his previous best scoring performance in a European-wide club competition with 62 points. Petrović was pressured to join the NBA, by the Trail Blazers, who had drafted him 60th overall in 1986. Being motivated by the potential new challenges that the NBA presented, Petrović finally decided to try to establish himself in the league. He left Spain rather abruptly, at the end of the season; the Blazers assisted him in the process, by buying out his contract with Real Madrid, for as much as US$1.5 million. Petrović finally joined the Blazers for the 1989–90 season. = The Blazers valued Petrović as a shooter, but were concerned that he might not possess the quickness to play guard or the foot speed to play defense. They brought him onto the team primarily as an outside threat to shoot three-pointers. In the Blazers\' offensive scheme he was to set up behind the line, receive a passed ball and go directly up to release his shot. Petrović was an aggressive, attacking player who was used to creating his shot and shots for his teammates. Taking the ball out of his hands and making him a static shooter was foreign to him. Making matters worse, the Blazers already had a full rotation of guards, with a starting backcourt of Clyde Drexler and Terry Porter, and with veteran Danny Young as a reserve. Consequently, the reigning La Gazzetta dello Sport Euroscar European Player of the Year saw limited playing time. He had difficulty being productive in the limited role the Blazers had for him.', 'His parents\' families hail from Janj near Šipovo in Bosanska Krajina. His sister Tijana is a volleyball player. Miličić played his first youth basketball in BFC Beočin until the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia that lasted from 24 March 1999 to 10 June 1999, when he was forced to take a break. After that, he played for the basketball club Sports World from Novi Sad, which is also a basketball school, where he became a dominant figure and received interest from bigger teams. Miličić played club basketball with his friend Nemanja Jokić, the older brother of Nikola Jokić. At the age of 14, Miličić started playing basketball with the Serbian team Hemofarm\'s junior team. He was later called up from the junior team before being drafted by the NBA\'s Detroit Pistons in 2003. = The Detroit Pistons chose Miličić with the second overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft. Unlike most teams with high draft choices, the Pistons were a good team that had made the Eastern Conference Finals the season before they drafted Miličić. The NBA draft rules had to be changed to allow Miličić to be drafted. The Pistons held the second overall draft pick because of a 1997 trade that had sent Otis Thorpe to the Vancouver Grizzlies. Miličić saw limited playing time during his first season with the Pistons, but did become the youngest player to appear in an NBA Finals game (18 years and 356 days) and won an NBA championship just five days later when the Pistons defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2004 NBA Finals. Pistons team president Joe Dumars repeatedly stated that Miličić would play a big part in the team\'s future, but he did not see a large increase in playing time during his second season. Miličić has been quoted on numerous occasions as attributing his slow development on his lack of playing time; ""I\'ve said it 10,000 times, the best way for me to improve is to play. All the work in practice and individual workouts can only help me so much"". After Larry Brown\'s departure, Flip Saunders was hired as head coach of the Pistons. Under Saunders, Miličić still averaged only 5.6 minutes per game, and received significant playing time only in blowout wins or blowout losses for the Pistons. Miličić\'s lack of playing time in Detroit was frequently highlighted in publications. In the 96 games he played as a Piston, he only scored a total of 152 points and averaged 1.6 points and 5.8 minutes per game. = On February 15, 2006, just prior to the NBA\'s All-Star break, Miličić was traded, along with point guard Carlos Arroyo, to the Orlando Magic for Kelvin Cato and a first-round pick in the 2007 NBA draft (Rodney Stuckey). During a game against the New York Knicks he played 32 minutes and finished with 13 points and seven rebounds.', 'During his playing career, he was listed as a 1.88 m (6\'2"") 90 kg (198 lb.) point guard. During his pro club playing career, Đorđević, along with his teammate Predrag Danilović, helped to lead Partizan to its first EuroLeague title in 1992, while he earned an All-Final Four Team selection in the process. He was twice named the Mister Europa Player of the Year, in both 1994 and 1995. He also played in a total of 108 games, while representing the senior national teams of SFR Yugoslavia, and later FR Yugoslavia. As a player, he won gold medals at the 1991 EuroBasket, the 1995 EuroBasket, the 1997 EuroBasket, where he was named the Most Valuable Player, and the 1998 FIBA World Championship. In 1995, Đorđević received the Golden Badge award for the Best Athlete of FR Yugoslavia, and the Yugoslav Olympic Committee declared him the Sportsman of the Year. In 2008, Đorđević was named one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors. Đorđević is most well-known for two famous game-winning shots that he hit during his playing career. He hit the game-winning shot of the 1992 EuroLeague Final, and the game-winning shot of the 1997 EuroBasket game between FR Yugoslavia and Croatia. He is the only person that has won medals at the Summer Olympic Games, the FIBA World Cup, and the FIBA EuroBasket, as both a player and as a head coach. Born in 1967 into a sporting family, both of Aleksandar\'s parents—retired basketball player father Bratislav a.k.a. Bata and mother Milijana—worked as primary school physical education teachers. His father simultaneously pursued basketball coaching, an activity that would eventually turn into a notable professional career after the summer 1971 marquee appointment as KK Crvena zvezda\'s head coach and immediate success leading the team to the Yugoslav League title, won in a dramatic neutral-venue, single-game playoff versus Jugoplastika Split that went into overtime. The family lived in New Belgrade where young Aleksandar a.k.a. Saša was immersed in basketball from an early age. Following in young Saša\'s footsteps, his younger brother Miloš would also end up pursuing basketball, getting as far as youth categories within the KK Partizan system. = Following his father\'s advice, sixteen-year-old Đorđević joined Partizan Belgrade during the summer of 1983. Arriving at the club coached by Bora Džaković with a roster featuring Nebojša Zorkić, Milenko Savović, Goran Grbović, Danko Cvjetićanin, Boban Petrović, Arsenije Pešić, and Miško Marić, the youngster got sporadic minutes at point guard during the league season as Partizan finished in the seventh spot, good for a play-in single-game showdown against lower-tier club Sloga Kraljevo for a chance to qualify for the playoffs quarterfinal. Partizan managed to defeat Sloga but then got swept by eternal rivals Red Star Belgrade in the best-of-three playoff quarterfinal series. Ahead of the next season, 1984-85, Partizan underwent a front-office shakeup that saw freshly-retired Yugoslav and club legend Dragan Kićanović appointed to the club vice-president post. The club also hired another Yugoslav basketball legend Moka Slavnić to be the new head coach thus giving him a chance to coach right after ending his illustrious playing career. In summer 1990, after being away from competitive basketball for a year due to serving his mandatory Yugoslav People\'s Army (JNA) stint, twenty-three-year-old Đorđević spent four months at the Boston Celtics\' free agent training camp, competing for a spot on the 1990–91 Celtics roster against some thirty other point guards. Đorđević joined the camp on recommendation from the Celtics\' scout Mišo Oštarčević, making it to the very end of the selection process before getting cut shortly before the season began due to Brian Shaw\'s return to the club from Virtus Roma. Đorđević\'s pro club career is most remembered for his game-winning, buzzer-beating three-pointer, in the 1991–92 FIBA European League (EuroLeague)\'s 1992 Final, which he hit in the game against the Spanish club Montigalà Joventut. He was named to the 1992 EuroLeague All-Final Four Team. In addition to winning Europe\'s most prestigious club title, the EuroLeague championship, with Partizan Belgrade in 1992, Đorđević also won Europe\'s third most important competition at that time, the FIBA Korać Cup title, in the 1988–89 season. He also won two Yugoslav First Federal League championships (1986–87 and 1991–92), and two Yugoslav Cups (1989 and 1992) while with the club. = Đorđević moved from Partizan Belgrade to Olimpia Milano, which competed in the top level Italian League, in 1992. He stayed at the club for two seasons, from 1992–93 to 1993–94. With Olimpia Milano, he won the FIBA Korać Cup championship, which was Europe\'s third most significant competition at that time, in the 1992–93 season. He was the top scorer of the finals. = Đorđević moved to the Italian League club Fortitudo Bologna, in 1994. He played with the club during the 1994–95 and 1995–96 seasons. = After the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Đorđević had a stint with the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), during the 1996–97 season. He made his NBA debut on 29 November 1996, recording 2 points and a rebound, in a 119–93 win over the Golden State Warriors.', 'Darko Miličić (Serbian Cyrillic: Дарко Миличић, Serbian pronunciation: [ˈdarko ˈmilit͡ʃit͡ɕ]; born 20 June 1985) is a Serbian former professional basketball player. He is 2.13 m (7 ft 0 in), and played the center position. Miličić played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 2003 to 2013. He is the fifth youngest player and the youngest foreign player to have played in the NBA, the youngest player to have played in an NBA Finals game, and the youngest player to win the NBA championship. Miličić was selected by the Detroit Pistons as the second overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft; he was chosen after number one pick LeBron James and ahead of other future NBA superstars including Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade. Selected with a high draft pick, Miličić never played at the level expected of him in the NBA and is widely considered a draft bust. While he won an NBA championship with the Pistons in 2004, Miličić never received significant playing time with the team and was traded to the Orlando Magic in 2006. Following stints with the Magic, the Memphis Grizzlies, and the New York Knicks, Miličić was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2010 and signed a four-year contract with the team that summer. After being released by Minnesota in 2012, he played one regular-season game for the Boston Celtics later that year before being released. Miličić announced his retirement from the NBA in 2013; he retired with career averages of 6.0 points and 4.2 rebounds per game. In international play, Miličić played for the Serbian national team.', ""During his freshman year at Arizona State, he met Jennie Campos, a Mexican-American. Jackson asked Campos on a date, and discovered many similarities, including the ability to speak Spanish, and being raised in a single parent home (Campos's father was killed in the Korean War). An assistant football coach tried to break up the couple because Jackson was black and Campos was considered white. The coach contacted Campos's uncle, a wealthy benefactor of the school, and he warned the couple that their being together was a bad idea.

He was a member of the Jugoplastika team of the late 1980s and early 1990s, which he helped to win two FIBA European Champions Cup championships (1989 and 1990). He spent three and a half seasons with the Boston Celtics, being one of the European pioneers in the NBA. Rađa was named one of FIBA\'s 50 Greatest Players in 1991, and one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors in 2008. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, as a member of the 2018 class. He was inducted into the Greek Basket League Hall of Fame, in 2022. = Rađa began his basketball life in his native town, as a junior at KK Dalvin. He moved to KK Split, which at the time went under the name of its longtime naming-rights sponsor Jugoplastika. At KK Split, Rađa starred alongside Toni Kukoč, while both were teenagers. The duo led the team to dominance of the FIBA European Champions Cup, with repeat championship seasons in (1989 and 1990). 1989–90: Defection to NBA, court-ordered return to Yugoslavia, and another Yugoslav & European title On 27 June 1989, two days after winning the EuroBasket 1989 championship with Yugoslavia and making the All-Tournament Team, the 22-year-old center got drafted by the Boston Celtics in the second round as the 40th pick. Rađa was reportedly on a vacation in Bologna, Italy with his girlfriend while the Celtics were drafting him in New York City\'s Felt Forum. Right away, he publicly expressed willingness to immediately go to Boston ""if the financial offer is good"", and thus join fellow Yugoslavs Vlade Divac, Dražen Petrović, and Žarko Paspalj, who were also on their way to the NBA that summer. However, led by the club\'s general manager Josip Bilić, vice-president Igor Katunarić, and executive board vice-president Željko Jerkov, Jugoplastika was adamant Rađa would not be released since they had him under contract until 1992. The entire case quickly turned into a months-long saga that played out in the Yugoslav media. The club\'s head coach, Božidar Maljković, even publicly called on the Yugoslav Basketball Association (KSJ) to adopt safeguard policies, preventing players younger than age 26 from transferring to NBA teams. After weeks of wrangling over his status, Rađa tried to force Jugoplastika\'s hand by travelling to the U.S. and, on 1 August 1989, unilaterally signing a one-year contract with the Celtics, reportedly worth in the neighborhood of US$500,000. He furthermore began practicing with the team at their Brandeis University training facilities. However, seeing the situation as a clear case of contract poaching by Boston and its general manager Jan Volk (who claimed Rađa\'s contract with Jugoplastika was amateur and thus non-binding), the Split club would not budge. Jugoplastika hired legal representation from the New York City-based Parcher, Arisohn & Hayes law firm, seeking an injunction to prevent Rađa from playing for the Celtics on the grounds that he has a valid and legally binding contract with them and further looking for US$6 million in damages on the grounds of ""damaged reputation and lost income"". The case ended up before the United States district court for the District of Massachusetts. Following a hearing on 26 September 1989, Judge Douglas Woodlock ruled in Jugoplastika\'s favor two days later thus preventing Rađa from staying with the Celtics. Since the player was physically already in Boston, bringing him back to Yugoslavia required some kind of an agreement. By mid-November 1989, Jugoplastika and the Celtics agreed to terms under which the center went back to complete the 1989–90 season in Split before having the rights to his services transferred to the Celtics effective 1 June 1990. The deal centered around the Celtics paying an undisclosed sum of money to Jugoplastika, which in turn agreed to let Rađa go two years short of his contract\'s completion. Rađa was thus back in Split for the 1989–90 season. That same season, Jugoplastika again won the Yugoslav League, its third consecutive national domestic league title, as well as its second straight FIBA European Champions Cup. Despite the team\'s success, as previously agreed, Rađa would not stay in Split past June 1990 thus relinquishing the chance to go for the historic FIBA European Champions Cup three-peat (which the club, led by Kukoč, achieved the following year), but he would not go to Boston either. = In August 1990, instead of going to the NBA as previously agreed, Rađa ended up in Italy, signing with the wealthy Virtus Roma despite claiming all along that he had wanted to join the Celtics. He had a change of heart once Virtus, an ambitious and financially stable club bankrolled by the Gruppo Ferruzzi food company and sponsored by the Il Messaggero daily broadsheet, made him an offer reportedly in the US$15–18 million range for a 5-year contract. Italian and Yugoslav newspapers reported that Rađa\'s L3.6 billion (~US$3 million) annual salary at the time at Virtus was higher than soccer superstars Diego Maradona\'s and Roberto Baggio\'s annual compensations at Napoli and Juventus, respectively. The Boston Celtics did not insist on Rađa honouring his commitment to them, instead letting the twenty-three-year-old go to Virtus in return for an undisclosed amount, but retaining his NBA rights. Reportedly, part of the reason Boston did not put up much of a fight when the player suddenly decided to sign with Virtus was the July 1990 court decision against them following a motion by Rađa\'s American agent, Marc Fleisher, after the Virtus offer came in. Taking advantage of an administrative loophole, Fleisher claimed that Rađa\'s contract with the Celtics violated a provision of the agreement between the league and the NBA players that said, among other things, that one-year contracts could not be extended. A special officer of the court had heard the case and ruled in Rađa\'s favour, against the Celtics. Simultaneous to the legal battle his agent was waging over the future of his club career, Rađa had been spending the summer of 1990 with the Yugoslav national team in a four-month 1990 FIBA World Championship training camp that included an appearance at the 1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle where the 23-year-old suffered a leg fracture in the final game against the U.S. national team, ruling him out of the World Championship that started a week later. Yugoslavia head coach Dušan Ivković later revealed that injured Rađa and the center\'s agent Marc Fleisher asked him not to publicly disclose the player\'s injury before the deal with Virtus is signed, which Ivković consented to. Some observers saw Virtus\' sudden and lucrative contract offer to Rađa as their retribution to the Celtics for going to court a few months earlier over enforcing Virtus\' point guard Brian Shaw\'s NBA contract and winning the case even after the player, who had spent the preceding 1989–90 season with Virtus, tried to remain in Rome. In 2005, commenting on his summer 1990 decision to stay in Europe, even after only a year prior seeming desperately intent on playing in the NBA, Rađa said: I was playing well. I was making a great salary in Europe.', 'On 16 December 2014 the Sacramento Kings retired his number.

""Tracy McGrady wishes he had stayed in Toronto: Feschuk"".', 'Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Douglas was listed as the No. 14 shooting guard and the No. 66 player in the nation in 2004. = Douglas committed to Auburn University during his junior year of high school. Playing as the starting shooting guard in his freshman season (2004–05), he led the team in scoring, at 16.9 points per game, and scored a team season-high (as well as career high) 38 points against Nicholls State. Douglas, who had the second-highest freshman scoring average in the nation, was voted to the All-SEC Freshman Team, third-team Freshman All-America, and third-team All-SEC—Douglas was the fourth Auburn freshman to be named to the latter. = Douglas submitted his name for the NBA draft in the 2005 offseason, but did not sign with an agent, therefore allowing him to stay eligible for college when he later withdrew from the process. Despite Douglas\' success at Auburn, he and his family were unhappy with his position on the basketball team. Douglas wanted to be the team\'s point guard, which he believed was his more natural position and the one he would play in the NBA. However, team management did not accede to his request, prompting him to request a transfer. Then-coach Jeff Lebo granted Douglas his scholarship release on the condition that he transfer to a non-SEC university. On June 29, 2005, Douglas enrolled at Florida State University, where coach Leonard Hamilton allowed him to play point guard. Because National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules stipulate that players who transfer must sit out the following season, Douglas only began playing with the team in the 2006–07 season, although he still practiced with them during 2005–06. = Sophomore year Douglas initially struggled at the point guard position while adjusting to the Florida State offense, but continued to play well in other respects. The early part of his sophomore season was highlighted by his shot block that helped to seal an upset victory against then-fourth-ranked University of Florida Gators, and a late-game period against Wake Forest in which he scored 10 consecutive points, leading Florida State to a win. On February 7, 2007, Douglas injured the fourth metacarpal in his right (shooting) hand, forcing him to sit out six games (nearly a month)—of which Florida State lost five. In his first game (against the University of Miami) after sustaining his injury, Douglas scored 13 points, including a three-pointer that tied the game and forced overtime; Florida State went on to win the game. Douglas finished the season with averages of 12.7 points, 2.9 assists and 2.7 rebounds per game. In three games of the 2007 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), he averaged 11.7 points and 3.7 rebounds, as Florida State won twice before losing to Mississippi State University in the semifinals. Junior year In his junior season, Douglas continued his transition to point guard, creating offensive opportunities for others on the team in addition to scoring by himself. Although Douglas still needed to work on polishing the distribution aspect of his game, coach Hamilton said in January 2008 that ""he\'s done an exceptional job when you take into consideration this hasn\'t been his role prior to coming to Florida State."" Douglas\' defense improved considerably; he accumulated 2.6 steals per game as a junior (compared to 1.2 steals in the previous season), the highest rate in the ACC. His total of 48 steals in 16 games against ACC teams is the third-highest in league history. In a game against the University of Virginia, Douglas\' steal in the final minute (his sixth of the game) and subsequent free throws carried Florida State to a win that helped their chances of being selected to the 2008 NCAA tournament. After the regular season concluded, Douglas was selected into the ACC All-Defensive Team and the All-ACC Third Team. Despite Douglas\' efforts (18 points, 5 assists and 3 steals) against North Carolina in the quarterfinals, Florida State lost the game, effectively shutting them out from the NCAA tournament. After Florida State lost in the first round of the 2008 NIT, Douglas finished the season with 90 steals, second only to Sam Cassell in the number of steals made in one season (97). He led the team in scoring (15.4 ppg), steals (2.6 spg; also highest in the ACC) and assists (2.6). Senior year The 2008–09 Florida State team was composed of mostly freshman and sophomores, which meant that the veteran Douglas, now a senior (one of three on the team), featured more prominently in the offense than in previous years. He started all 35 games of the season, one of two Seminole players to do so. Douglas became the primary threat on offense, and was the sole top scorer for the team in 23 games. His scoring average increased by more than six points, to 21.5 points per game, which was the highest average on the team and in the ACC; he also averaged 2.9 assists, a team and career high, and 3.9 rebounds.

In his team\'s final home game of the season, a 120–109 victory over the Phoenix Suns on April 9, Nowitzki scored 30 points, and announced his retirement in an emotional ceremony during which Charles Barkley, Larry Bird, Shawn Kemp, Scottie Pippen, and Detlef Schrempf appeared on the court to give laudatory speeches for Nowitzki. One day later, he played his final NBA game, recording a double-double with 20 points and 10 rebounds in a 105–94 loss to the Spurs. Nowitzki began playing for the German national basketball team in 1997. In his debut tournament, the EuroBasket 1999, the 21-year-old rookie emerged as the main German scorer, but Germany finished seventh and failed to qualify for the 2000 Olympic Games. In the EuroBasket 2001, Nowitzki was top scorer with 28.7 points per game, and narrowly lost the MVP vote to Serbian player Peja Stojaković. Germany reached the semi-finals and were close to beating host nation Turkey, but Hedo Türkoğlu hit a three-point buzzer beater to tie it, and the Turks eventually won in overtime. Germany then lost, 99–90, against Spain, and did not win a medal. However, with averages of 28.7 points and 9.1 rebounds, Nowitzki led the tournament in both statistics, and was voted to the All-Star team. Back home, the German basketball team attracted up to 3.7 million television viewers, a German basketball record at the time. Nowitzki earned his first medal when he led Germany to a bronze medal in the 2002 FIBA World Championship. In the quarter-finals against the Pau Gasol-led Spain, Spain was up 52–46 after three-quarters, but then Nowitzki scored 10 points in the last quarter and led Germany to a 70–62 win. In the semi-finals, his team played against the Argentinian team led by Manu Ginóbili, but despite leading, 74–69, four minutes from the end and despite Argentina losing Ginobili to a foot injury, the South Americans won, 86–80. However, the Germans won 117–94 against New Zealand in the consolation finals and won bronze, and Nowitzki, as the tournament\'s top scorer, (24.0 points per game), was elected the tournament MVP. Back in Germany, over four million television viewers followed the games, an all-time record in German basketball history. In a preparation game for EuroBasket 2003, Nowitzki suffered a foot injury after a collision with French player Florent Piétrus; as a result, Nowitzki played inconsistently and was also often target of hard fouls. In the decisive second-round match against Italy (only the winner was allowed to play the medal round), Germany lost, 86–84, finished ninth and did not qualify for the 2004 Olympic Games. Nowitzki scored 22.5 points per game (third overall), but in general seemed to lack focus and dominance due to his injury. In the EuroBasket 2005, Nowitzki led a depleted German squad into the Finals, beating title favorites Slovenia in the quarter-finals and Spain in the semi-finals on the way. EuroBasket pundits praised Nowitzki in both matches: against Slovenia (76–62), the forward scored a game-high 22 points and commented: ""The Slovenians underestimated us. They said we were the team they wanted and that was wrong, you shouldn\'t do that in the quarter-finals."" Against Spain (74–73), Nowitzki scored a game-high 27 points and scored the decisive basket: down by one and with only a few seconds to go, he drove on Spanish forward Jorge Garbajosa, and hit a baseline jump shot over Garbajosa\'s outstretched arms with 3.9 seconds to go. The German later commented: ""It was indescribable. Garbajosa kind of pushed me towards the baseline so I just went with it."" Despite losing the Finals, 78–62, to the Greeks, Nowitzki was the tournament\'s leading scorer (26.1 per game), and second-leading rebounder (10.6 per game), and shot blocker (1.9 per game), and he was also voted the Most Valuable Player of the tournament. When he was subbed out towards the end of the final, Nowitzki received a standing ovation from the crowd, which he later recalled as ""one of the best moments of [his] career"". The German team was awarded a silver medal. In the 2006 FIBA World Championship, Nowitzki led the German team to an eighth place and commented: ""It\'s tough luck. But overall, finishing eighth in the world is not bad."" In the EuroBasket 2007, in which the top three teams automatically qualified for the 2008 Olympics, Nowitzki led Germany to a fifth place. He was the leading scorer with 24.0 points per game. The fifth place meant that Germany fell short of direct qualification, but was allowed to participate in the 2008 Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Nowitzki led Germany into a decisive match against Puerto Rico for the last remaining slot. In that crucial match, he scored a game-high 32 points and was vital for the 96–82 win which sent the German basketball team to their first Olympics since the 1992 Summer Olympics. Nowitzki was chosen to be the flag bearer for the German Olympic Team at the Opening Ceremony for the 2008 Olympics. Nowitzki led the German team to a tenth-place finish, and averaged 17.0 points and 8.4 rebounds for the tournament. In 2009, Nowitzki skipped the EuroBasket 2009. In July 2010, he said that he would skip the 2010 FIBA World Championship. In summer 2011, Nowitzki played with Germany in the EuroBasket 2011, where the team reached ninth place. In 2015, Nowitzki captained Germany at the EuroBasket. They won only one game, and were eliminated in the group stage, on home soil. In January 2016, Nowitzki officially announced his retirement from Germany\'s national team. In his career with Germany\'s senior men\'s national team, he averaged 19.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 1.6 assists per game. Nowitzki was named the Euroscar European Basketball Player of the Year by the Italian sports newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport for five years running from 2002 to 2006 and again in 2011. He was also named the Mister Europa European Player of the Year by the Italian sports magazine Superbasket in 2005, and the FIBA Europe Men\'s Player of the Year twice in 2005 and 2011. He was named to the FIBA EuroBasket 2000–2020 Dream Team in 2020. The German Basketball Federation (DBB) honored Nowitzki with a jersey (number 14) retirement in September 2022, ahead of EuroBasket 2022. The ceremony was held on September 2, immediately before Germany\'s EuroBasket opening game against France in Cologne. DBB also announced that a replica of Nowitzki\'s national team jersey would hang from the arena rafters at all future Germany men\'s home games. Nowitzki was a versatile frontcourt player who mostly played the power forward, but also played center and small forward in his career. An exceptional shooter for his size, Nowitzki made 88% of his free throws, nearly 50% of his field goal attempts and nearly 40% of his 3-point shots, and won the 2006 NBA All-Star Three-Point Contest. In the 2006–07 season, Nowitzki became only the fifth member of the NBA\'s 50–40–90 Club for players who shot 50% or better from the field, 40% or better on three-pointers, and 90% or better on free-throws in a single season while achieving the NBA league minimum number of makes in each category. Nowitzki\'s shooting accuracy, combined with his long seven-foot frame and unique shooting mechanics (such as having a release point above his head), made his jump shots difficult to contest. Before the start of the 2011 NBA Finals, LeBron James called Nowitzki\'s one-legged fadeaway the second most unstoppable move ever, behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\'s skyhook. Additionally, Nowitzki could drive to the basket from the perimeter like few men his size were able to do. NBA.com lauded his versatility by stating: ""The 7–0 forward who at times mans the pivot can strike fear in an opponent when he corrals a rebound and leads the break or prepares to launch a three-point bomb."" Charles Barkley said the best way to guard Nowitzki was to ""get a cigarette and a blindfold"". Later on in his career, Nowitzki also developed an unorthodox post-up game, often backing down his opponents from the free-throw line or near the middle of the key, opening up the floor for multiple passing angles should a double team come his way. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA\'s 75th Anniversary The Athletic ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Nowitzki as the 21st greatest player in NBA history. Nowitzki was the sixth player in NBA history, and the first European, to hit the 30,000-point milestone. Apart from being the Mavericks\' all-time leader in points, rebounds, field goals, field goal attempts, 3-pointers, 3-point attempts, blocks, free throws, and free-throw attempts, Nowitzki made the NBA All-Star games fourteen times and the All-NBA Teams twelve times. He was voted NBA MVP of the 2006–07 NBA season, becoming the first European player to receive the honor, as well as the MVP of the 2011 NBA Finals.', ""The Nets finished the season with a 48–24 record, and the second seed in the East.

His 48 points were the most in a Game 7 in NBA playoff history at the time. Playoff disappointment (2021–2022) On August 8, 2021, Durant signed a four-year, $198 million extension with the Nets.

Brooklyn would go on to lose to Boston in four games despite Durant's 39-point, 7-rebound and 9-assist outing in the 116–112 close-out loss in Game 4. Over the first three contests, he would be held to just under 37% shooting from the field, including a 4-of-17 shooting performance in Game 2, in a series dominated by the Celtics' top-ranked defense as Durant was swept for the first time in his 14-year NBA career.

He was a power forward for the UCLA Bruins on their 1995 NCAA championship team. He was selected by the New Jersey Nets with the ninth overall pick of the 1995 NBA draft. After two seasons in the NBA, he continued his professional career for another eight years, mainly playing in Europe. O\'Bannon was the lead plaintiff in O\'Bannon v. NCAA, an antitrust class action lawsuit against the National Collegiate Athletic Association which resulted in the discontinuation of NCAA video games. O\'Bannon grew up in South Los Angeles and attended Verbum Dei High School before graduating from Artesia High School. He averaged 24.6 points, 9.7 rebounds in his senior year at Artesia. He led the school to a 29–2 record that year, and they won the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Division II state championship. He was the most valuable player (MVP) at the Dapper Dan Classic, a high school All-Star game, and he was named a McDonald\'s High School All-American. He was also honored by Basketball Times as its national high school player of the year. O\'Bannon originally planned to attend the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), but he did not sign a letter of intent with the university at the suggestion of UNLV head coach Jerry Tarkanian. However, when UNLV\'s men\'s basketball program was placed on probation due to recruiting improprieties, O\'Bannon rescinded his commitment and instead attended UCLA. Six days before the official start of practice at UCLA, O\'Bannon tore his anterior cruciate ligament as he landed awkwardly on a dunk during a pickup game with other Bruins. He was told he might not be able to walk properly again, but eighteen months later, after receiving a graft from a cadaver, he returned to playing basketball. In his first year, he came off the bench in 23 games and averaged fewer than four points while never starting. In his second season in 1993, O\'Bannon was named to the first team All-Pacific-10 (Pac-10) Conference team. In his junior year, he was named the team\'s MVP and was again first team All-Pac-10. In his senior year in 1994–95, O\'Bannon was the key to UCLA\'s 1995 NCAA Basketball Championship, scoring 30 points and taking 17 rebounds and was named the NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player. For the season, he averaged 20.4 points (.533 field-goal percentage, .433 3-point percentage) and 8.3 rebounds, earning him the John R. Wooden Award, USBWA College Player of the Year (now Oscar Robertson Trophy), and the CBS/Chevrolet Player of the Year. He was a consensus first team All-American, Pac-10 co-Player of the Year along with Damon Stoudamire, first team All-Pac-10 for the third consecutive year, and UCLA\'s co-MVP along with Tyus Edney. His number 31 was retired by UCLA in 1996. He was also inducted into UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Pac-12 Basketball Hall of Honor in 2012. Leading up to the 1995 NBA draft, O\'Bannon hoped to be drafted by a team on the west coast. Selected ninth overall by the New Jersey Nets, he signed a three-year, $3.9 million contract. However, he became homesick. In his two professional seasons, he was unable to find a place in the NBA, being too lean to play down low and not quick enough with his rebuilt knees to guard the perimeter. His knee also started to break down. He averaged 6.2 and 4.2 points per game respectively with the Nets and was traded to the Dallas Mavericks later in his second and final NBA season, where he had even less of an impact. In September 1997 he was traded along with Derek Harper to the Orlando Magic for Dennis Scott, and was waived by the Magic afterwards. ""It wasn\'t injury, it was confidence,"" O\'Bannon said about his NBA career. ""I missed shots, got pulled from games, it affected my defense, and I lost all my confidence."" Former Nets teammate Armon Gilliam said, ""He\'s a guy who didn\'t find his niche in the NBA. He wasn\'t in the right situation to grow and develop. He never got the opportunity to prove what he could do."" After his NBA career, O\'Bannon played professional basketball seven years overseas in Italy, Spain, Greece, Argentina and Poland (in Anwil Włocławek, Polonia Warsaw and Astoria Bydgoszcz). He also played one year for the startup American Basketball Association (ABA) with the Los Angeles Stars. After the NBA, he only had one-year contracts and never made more than $400,000 in a season.

He said that he would prefer to see a child being raised by two men or two women rather than to see that child in an orphanage. In March 2020, Ginóbili also expressed support for gay people playing basketball and expressed hope that the issue of sexual orientation will no longer be important soon.

However, Ginóbili did not sign with the Spurs at this point. Instead, he returned to Italy to play for Kinder Bologna, whom he helped win the 2001 Italian League Championship, the 2001 and 2002 Italian Cups, and the 2001 EuroLeague. In the lattermost, Ginóbili was named the 2001 EuroLeague\'s Finals MVP. He was also named the Italian League MVP in 2000–01 and 2001–02, and made the Italian League\'s All-Star Game three times during this period. While playing with the Argentina national team at the 2002 FIBA World Championship in Indianapolis, Ginóbili made the All-Tournament Team, alongside future NBA star Yao Ming and established NBA stars Dirk Nowitzki and Peja Stojaković, and helped lead Argentina to a second-place finish. = Early NBA career and first championship (2002–2004) Ginóbili joined the Spurs for the 2002–03 NBA season, where he played backup for veteran guard Steve Smith. Ginóbili spent much of the early season injured, and found it hard to adjust to the NBA\'s style of play. As his injury improved, so did Ginóbili, winning the Western Conference Rookie of the Month in March, and being named to the All-Rookie Second Team at the end of the season. Still, he only started in five games as the Spurs chalked up a 60–22 regular season win–loss record. The Spurs then entered the playoffs eager to upend the defending champions Los Angeles Lakers, at which point Ginóbili rose to prominence. In contrast to his regular season, Ginóbili became an integral part of Gregg Popovich\'s rotation in the playoffs, playing in every game. The Spurs eliminated Phoenix and Los Angeles and in those games, Ginóbili\'s scoring threat took opponents by surprise, giving them one more thing to cope with against the now highly favored Spurs. He helped guide them past the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals and then the New Jersey Nets in the Finals, securing San Antonio\'s second championship. After the win, Ginóbili won his first Olimpia de Oro (""Golden Olympia"") as Argentina\'s sportsperson of the year, and met Argentine president Néstor Kirchner. A gym in Bahía Blanca was also dedicated in Ginóbili\'s honor. In the 2003–04 season, the Spurs began featuring Ginóbili more prominently, starting him in half of the 77 regular season games in which he played. Ginóbili\'s statistics improved in all major categories, as he averaged 12.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game. During the 2004 playoffs, the Spurs lost again to the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semifinals. Following Game 5 where Derek Fisher scored a buzzer-beating jump shot, the Spurs lost Game 6 and the series 4–2. While Ginóbili did not start in a single playoff game as he did in 2003, his playoff statistics improved significantly, with 13.0 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per game. Peak years: second and third championships (2004–2011) After some initial issues with San Antonio over his contract, Ginóbili re-signed with the Spurs and started every game during the 2004–05 season. This was his best season yet as he was selected as a reserve by NBA coaches to the 2005 Western Conference All-Star team, marking his debut in the elite mid-season showcase. During the playoffs, Ginóbili\'s play was pivotal to winning San Antonio\'s third championship. The Spurs first defeated Phoenix 4–1 in the Conference Finals, before prevailing in a very defense-oriented seven-game series against the Detroit Pistons. Ginóbili recorded career-highs in his playoff numbers, most notably 20.8 ppg and 5.8 rpg, and had the third-highest point total in the entire playoffs.

He returned to action on 5 March against the Houston Rockets after missing 16 games.', 'His Porsche Cayenne Turbo was totalled in the accident, and he missed that night\'s game and the next game due to back spasms. 2006–07 season In his third year, Biedriņš got a lucky break when the Warriors decided to replace coach Mike Montgomery with ex-Dallas Mavericks coach Don Nelson, elected one of the NBA\'s ""Greatest Coaches of All Time."" Nelson needed just five games to bench the Warriors\' center Adonal Foyle and give Biedriņš the starting spot at center, calling him ""the best big man I\'ve got."" Biedriņš thrived in his new role, posting impressive averages of 10.3 points on an incredible .621 field goal percentage (1st in the NBA), 9.5 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game and earning himself 28.9 minutes of playing time. His breakthrough game came in November 2006, when the Warriors beat the title favorites San Antonio Spurs 119–111. In this game, Biedriņš asserted himself against Spurs superstar Tim Duncan, only being narrowly outscored 18–22 and outrebounded 15–16, but did block six shots, including three straight shot attempts by Duncan in the third quarter. During this season he set career highs in points (31 vs Denver 24 November 2006), rebounds (18 vs Charlotte 2 March 2007), blocks (7 vs Denver 22 November 2006), assists (5 vs Washington 23 March 2007) and steals (5 vs Lakers 22 January 2007). He also finished fifth in Most Improved Player voting, losing to teammate Monta Ellis. 2008–09 season In July 2008, Biedriņš agreed to a new six-year contract for $54 million ($62 million including incentives) with the Golden State Warriors. The final year was a player option, which if exercised would keep him a Warrior until 2014. Biedriņš was named co-captain alongside Stephen Jackson. On January 27, Biedriņš pulled down a career high 26 rebounds against New York. He had set a career high in assists on December 19 against Atlanta with six. For the season, Biedriņš set career highs in points (11.9), rebounds (11.2), assists (two) and blocked shots (1.6) per game, starting in 58 of the 62 games in which he appeared. 2009–10 season In the 2009–10 season, Biedriņš appeared in only 33 games, starting 29, and was limited to 23.1 minutes per game, his lowest since his second season in the league (2005–2006). Injuries played a big role, as he was derailed with back and groin ailments that made him miss weeks at a time before he finally had groin surgery on March 10, ending his season. Biedriņš\' free-throw percentage had dropped from 62% in 2007–08 to 55.1% in 2008–09; in 2009–10, he shot an appalling four-for-25 (16%). His other numbers dropped precipitously as well—five points, 7.8 rebounds and 1.3 blocks per game after career highs in all these stats in 2008–09. Additionally, Warriors coach Don Nelson repeatedly criticized Biedriņš for his lack of intensity and aggressiveness in his time on the floor. Biedriņš capped of the off-season by criticizing the team during an interview in his native Latvia. 2010–11 season The 2010–2011 season may have begun with some renewed hope for a resurgence of Biedriņš, as 2009–10 coach Don Nelson was fired and the potential existed for new head coach Keith Smart to unleash and reinvigorate the center\'s fragile confidence. Early returns were promising, as Biedriņš had several games in the early season with rebounding numbers at or around double-digits while averaging around thirty minutes per game, including 20 rebounds in a November 5 victory over the Utah Jazz, 28 points and 20 rebounds in a November 26 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, and 18 rebounds in a November 30 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. However, the injury bug bit again, derailing Biedriņš from mid-December 2010 to early January 2011, and once again he found it difficult to regain his previous form. Biedriņš\'s slumping play and persistent foul issues convinced Smart to bench him in favor of rookie Ekpe Udoh for four games in March. He was reinstated into the starting lineup for five games until spraining his ankle on March 16, resulting in his being sidelined for the remainder of the season. Biedriņš\'s averages for the 2010–11 season amounted to five points, 7.2 rebounds and 0.9 blocks (both a drop from 2009–10) on 53.4% field goal shooting and a modestly improved 32.3% free throw accuracy. 2011–12 season In the wake of the lockout which took away much of the 2011 NBA offseason and shortened the league\'s schedule considerably, the Warriors made a push to acquire restricted free agent DeAndre Jordan, who would have automatically taken over as the starting center for Golden State. Biedriņš might have been a logical amnesty candidate under the provisions of the NBA\'s new collective bargaining agreement, but the Warriors instead chose to amnesty Charlie Bell while retaining Biedriņš. The Warriors\' push to acquire Jordan fell through when the Los Angeles Clippers matched the Warriors\' offer sheet to Jordan, so they instead signed free agent center Kwame Brown. Biedriņš won the starting job to begin the year before being sidelined for three games with an ankle injury. When Brown was lost for the season with a torn pectoralis major muscle in the third of those games, Biedriņš once again took over as starter, where he remained until his continued ineffectiveness prompted first-year coach Mark Jackson to insert Ekpe Udoh in as starter. A March 13 trade which shipped Udoh, Brown and Monta Ellis to the Milwaukee Bucks for Stephen Jackson and the out-for-the-season Andrew Bogut thrust Biedriņš back into the starting lineup, where he remained until Jackson decided to give rookie Jeremy Tyler a chance to prove himself at the beginning of April. For the season, Biedriņš averaged 15.7 minutes (the lowest since his second year in the league), 1.7 points, 3.7 rebounds, 0.3 assists (all career lows), 1.0 blocks and 0.5 steals while shooting 60.9% from the floor and 11.1% from the free throw line (admittedly with the small sample size of one make in nine free throw attempts). 2012–13 season Biedriņš\'s struggles intensified during the 2012–13 season. Relatively healthy, he appeared in 53 games for 9.3 minutes per game, but attempted a grand total of only 21 shots (making 10, a 47.6% mark) and 13 free throws (making four, a 30.8% mark). For the season, Biedriņš averaged 0.5 points, 2.9 rebounds, 0.3 assists, 0.3 steals and 0.8 blocks. = On July 5, 2013, the Warriors reportedly agreed to trade Biedriņš to the Utah Jazz along with teammates Brandon Rush and Richard Jefferson in an attempt to clear salary cap space to acquire coveted free agent Andre Iguodala. The trade became official on July 10.', ""Filling in for Bucks' injured starting point guard T."", 'While he was again a bench player with the Bucks, his minutes still remained relatively high and Ellis still made large contributions to the team with his scoring ability. Following the conclusion of the 91–92 season, he found himself traded to the San Antonio Spurs for Tracy Murray.

During his career Ellis was one of the best scorers in the league, averaging close to 25 points per game on two occasions. After six and a half seasons with Golden State, he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in March 2012. A season and a half with the Bucks was followed by two seasons with the Dallas Mavericks and finally, two seasons with the Indiana Pacers. Ellis attended Lanier High School in Jackson, Mississippi.

In game 4 against the Wizards, George scored a then playoff career-high 39 points. The Pacers were eliminated in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Miami Heat for the third straight year. For his efforts, George was named to the All-NBA third team, which qualified him for the full 30% extension and All-Defensive First Team. 2014–15 season: off-season injury During the 2014 off-season, George was named to the training camp roster for the US national team that would represent the country at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain. George had been considered a virtual lock to make the roster, but he landed awkwardly at the base of a basket stanchion after fouling James Harden during a Las Vegas scrimmage on August 1, and suffered a compound fracture of both bones in his lower right leg. After George was carted off the court, head coach Mike Krzyzewski addressed the arena stating the scrimmage would not continue out of respect to George and his family. George quickly went into surgery for the fracture, with a pin being inserted in the leg. While no official prognosis was initially given, he was considered likely to miss the entire 2014–15 season. George, who had said he wanted to play at some time during the season, was cleared to put weight on the leg in late September, and was shooting jumpers in practice in late October. He participated in his first full practice of the season on February 26, three days earlier than expected, and was ruled a possibility to play within a week on March 20. On April 5, George made his return to the Pacers line-up for the first time since sustaining his leg injury with Team USA.

At Kentucky he was a highly regarded incoming freshman that Wildcats head coach Eddie Sutton considered to be the next Sam Bowie. LeRon Ellis played a secondary role, mostly coming off the bench, behind center Robert Lock and power forward Winston Bennett during his freshman season. However Ellis did manage to break into the starting lineup several times, making his debut as a starter on January 31, 1988, against Notre Dame where he enjoyed a then-career high of 14 points and five steals. LeRon Ellis averaged 4.3 points per game and 13.8 minutes per game, while starting in 12 of 28 games during the 1987–88 season. All-American and All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) basketball star Rex Chapman led Kentucky that season to their 37th SEC title with a 27–6 record. The Wildcats were ranked as the 6th college basketball team in the nation by the Associated Press and UPI and secured the number two Southeast Conference seed in the 1988 NCAA Men\'s Division I Basketball Tournament. Kentucky\'s talents led the team to the tournament\'s Sweet Sixteen, where they suffered a defeat against Villanova. LeRon Ellis made local headlines at the start of his sophomore year when he became the first African American inducted into the University of Kentucky\'s Kappa Alpha Order fraternity. Ellis was also the center of attention on the court as many of Kentucky\'s high-profile basketball players were unable to play in the 1988–89 season. Offensive and defensive stars Ed Davender, Robert Lock and Winston Bennett graduated from school; the Wildcats\' MVP Rex Chapman left school early to enter the 1988 NBA draft; sophomore standout Eric Manuel was suspended for the entire season from playing basketball and potential franchise recruit Shawn Kemp was transferred out of the university before the start of the season. Kentucky\'s basketball program was essentially put into the hands of the inexperienced sophomore LeRon Ellis and freshman Chris Mills. The two underclassmen struggled to fill the talent vacuum on the court and even prior to the season many had predicted rough times ahead for the Wildcats\' 1988–89 season. Ellis led Kentucky in points that season while starting in the power forward and center positions. The talented sophomore would experience his best offensive season in his entire collegiate career, averaging a career high of 16 points per game and a 51.9% field goal percentage, including noteworthy defensive numbers with 5.5 rebounds per game as well as 1.1 blocks per game. Ellis\' best single game outing (and arguably the highlight of his Kentucky tenure) was his performance against Northwestern University where he set a career-high as a Wildcat with 37 points in one game while netting 14 of 17 field goals The feat placed him in the record books then as the second most points scored by a Kentucky sophomore in a single game. The Wildcats\' star was honored for his outstanding performance at the University of Kentucky\'s annual awards banquet where he received the ""Most Points"" and ""Most Sacrifice"" awards. However Ellis was not without his own shortcomings, being considered inconsistent on offense and weak on defense. In the end, Ellis was unable to lift Kentucky out of their battered season that was marred by poor performances on the court and an ongoing NCAA investigation into the school\'s basketball program off the court. The Wildcats finished with a losing record of 13–19; as of 2017, this remains the school\'s only losing season since 1927. To add injury to insult, the NCAA announced at the end of the season that its investigation into the University of Kentucky\'s basketball program had found the school responsible of violating NCAA recruitment policies. Consequently, the Wildcats were reprimanded with a three-year probation and LeRon Ellis shortly thereafter announced that he would no longer be attending Kentucky. Ellis again was courted by some of the nation\'s top college basketball programs upon making his announcement. He traveled across the country visiting UCLA, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) and Syracuse University during the 1989 summer. Ellis was keenly interested in transferring to UNLV but had a sudden change of heart after discovering that their basketball program was under NCAA investigation and could possibly face sanctions similar to the University of Kentucky. Though unaware at the time, LeRon Ellis could have potentially been a member of the 1990 UNLV Runnin\' Rebels NCAA Men\'s Division I Basketball Championship team had he decided to enroll at UNLV in 1989. LeRon Ellis eventually announced on July 17, 1989, that he would transfer to Syracuse. Ellis was allowed to play in the upcoming 1989–90 season and would not have to sit out a season as a redshirt transfer because the University of Kentucky was placed on probation. LeRon Ellis played his final two college seasons at Syracuse University. He was selected 22nd overall in the 1991 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers and went on to play three NBA seasons for the Clippers, Charlotte Hornets and Miami Heat.']",Glenn Robinson III replaced Monta Ellis in the starting lineup for the Pacers after Ellis returned from his groin injury.,Glenn Robinson III,0.5,0.9724069168910788,0.5512477718268197,1.0,0.7241491052479314,0.8965964209917255

Jones played for the Ball High School Golden Tornadoes basketball team. He went on to the University of Houston after his graduation in 1994. A journeyman throughout his career, Jones never played for the same team for more than one season except for 2005–2008, when he played for the Cleveland Cavaliers. In his career, he played for ten different teams. Jones was most notable for his ability to make three-point field goals. In fact, three-point attempts made up the majority of his field goal attempts because his role was often to wait on the outside while teammates such as Shaquille O\'Neal, Dwyane Wade, or LeBron James forced double teams. Jones was supremely confident of his shot, once proclaiming that he is ""the best shooter in the world."" = Jones played for the Idaho Stampede of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) during the 1998–99 season. He was selected as the CBA Newcomer of the Year and named to the All-CBA First Team. = Prior to the 2004–2005 season, Jones signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract with the Miami Heat. Jones then proceeded to have the best statistical season of his career, setting career highs in games started (66), minutes played (2,576), field goals made (331) and attempted (726), field goal percentage (45.6%), three-point field goals made (225) and attempted (521), three-point field goal percentage (43.2%), free throws made (68) and attempted (86), rebounds (231), steals (44), blocked shots (5) and points scored (955). His 225 three-point field goals made was third best in the NBA (and at the time, tied with Mitch Richmond for the ninth most ever in an NBA season) and his three-point field goal percentage was fifth best that season. Jones had a career-high 31 points on February 16, 2005, against the Los Angeles Clippers and scored in double figures on 48 occasions. He also had his only game with two blocked shots on March 10, 2005, against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Jones grabbed a career-high eight rebounds on November 6, 2004, against the Washington Wizards, a mark he tied on February 22, 2005, against the Chicago Bulls.

He had a career playoff high of 30 points with seven three-point field goals made in Miami\'s first game of the first round against the New Jersey Nets. Jones scored in double digits during 10 of Miami\'s 15 playoff games. = Jones departed the Heat to sign a four-year contract worth a reported $16.1 million with the Cleveland Cavaliers on September 8, 2005.

It was important psychologically to walk off the court on my own."" After the basket, Barkley immediately retired and concluded his sixteen-year Hall of Fame career. Barkley was invited by Bob Knight to try out for United States men\'s basketball team for the 1984 Summer Olympics. He made it all the way to final cuts, but was not selected for the team, despite outplaying almost all of the front-court players there. According to Knight, Barkley was cut because of poor defense. Barkley competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games and won two gold medals as a member of the United States men\'s basketball team. International rules that previously prevented NBA players from playing in the Olympics were changed in 1992, allowing Barkley and fellow NBA players to compete in the Olympics for the first time. The team was nicknamed the ""Dream Team"" and went 6–0 in the Olympic qualifying tournament and 8–0 against Olympic opponents. The team averaged an Olympic record 117.3 points a game and won games by an average of 43.8 points, only surpassed by the 1956 U.S. Olympic team. Barkley led the team with 18.0 points on 71.1% field goal shooting and set a then-Olympic single-game scoring record with 30 points in a 127–83 victory over Brazil. He also set a U.S. Men\'s Olympic record for highest three-point field goal percentage with 87.5% and added 4.1 rebounds and 2.6 steals per game. During the game versus Angola, Barkley elbowed Herlander Coimbra in the chest and was unapologetic after the game, claiming he was hit first. Barkley was called for an intentional foul on the play. Coimbra\'s resulting free throw was the only point scored by Angola during a 46–1 run by the U.S. At the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games, Barkley led the team in scoring, rebounds, and field goal percentage. He averaged 12.4 points on 81.6% field goal shooting, setting a U.S. Men\'s Olympic record. In addition, he also contributed 6.6 rebounds per game. Under Barkley\'s leadership, the team once again compiled a perfect 8–0 record and captured gold medal. Barkley played the power forward position, but occasionally played small forward and center. He was known for his unusual build as a basketball player, stockier than most small forwards, yet shorter than most power forwards he faced. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his unusual combination of strength and agility. Barkley was a prolific scorer who averaged 22.1 points per game during the regular season for his career and 23.0 points per game in the playoffs for his career. Barkley was an incredibly efficient offensive force, leading the NBA in 2-point field goal percentage every season from the 1986–87 season to the 1990–91 season. He led the league in effective field goal percentage in both the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons as well, and also led the league in offensive rating in both the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons. He was one of the NBA\'s most versatile players and accurate scorers capable of scoring from anywhere on the court and established himself as one of the NBA\'s premier clutch players. During his NBA career, Barkley was a constant mismatch because he possessed a very uncommon combination of skills and could play in a variety of positions. He would use all facets of his game in a single play; as a scorer, he had the ability to score from the perimeter and the post, using an array of spin moves and fadeaways, or finishing a fast break with a powerful dunk. He was one of the most efficient scorers of all time, scoring at 54.13% total field goal percentage for his season career and 51.34% total field goal shooting for his playoff career (including a career-high season average of 60% during the 1989–90 NBA season). Barkley is the shortest player in NBA history to lead the league in rebounding when he averaged a career-high 14.6 rebounds per game during the 1986–87 season. His tenacious and aggressive form of play built into an undersized frame that fluctuated between 284 pounds (129 kg) and 252 pounds (114 kg) helped cement his legacy as one of the greatest rebounders in NBA history, averaging 11.7 rebounds per game in the regular season for his career and 12.9 rebounds per game in his playoff career and totaling 12,546 rebounds for his season career. Barkley topped the NBA in offensive rebounding for three straight years and was most famous among very few power forwards who could control a defensive rebound, dribble the length of the court and finish at the rim with a powerful dunk. Barkley also possessed considerable defensive talents led by an aggressive demeanor, foot speed and his capacity to read the floor to anticipate for steals, a reason why he established his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power forward position and leader of the highest all-time steal per game average for the power forward position. Despite being undersized for both the small forward and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in blocked shots. His speed and leaping ability made him one of the few power forwards capable of running down court to block a faster player with a chase-down block. In a SLAM magazine issue ranking NBA greats, Barkley was ranked among the top 20 players of All-Time. In the magazine, NBA Hall-of-Famer Bill Walton commented on Barkley\'s ability. Walton stated, ""Barkley is like Magic [Johnson] and Larry [Bird] in that they don\'t really play a position. He plays everything; he plays basketball.', ""Clint N'Dumba Capela (born May 18, 1994) is a Swiss professional basketball player for the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

After attending Rangitoto College in Auckland, Marks moved to the United States in 1992 to play for the University of California, Berkeley where he majored in political science, graduating with a BA degree in 1998. He was drafted 44th overall in the 1998 NBA draft by the New York Knicks, and was traded on draft night, alongside Charles Oakley, to the Toronto Raptors for Marcus Camby.

In 2000–01, Marks started the season with Śląsk Wrocław of Poland, and in December 2000 had an unsuccessful ten-day contract (0 games) with the Seattle SuperSonics, returning to his Polish team until the season ended. In 2003–04, while with the Spurs, he did not play a single second due to patella tendonitis.

Scola has been a regular member of the Argentina national basketball team since 1999, winning an Olympic gold medal in 2004 and a bronze medal in 2008. In 2010, Scola won the Konex Award Merit Diploma as one of the five best basketball players from the last decade in Argentina. He was honored as the national flag bearer at the 2016 Summer Olympics. = Scola started his career with the Buenos Aires youth teams of Ferro Carril Oeste. He made his professional debut with the same club's pro team in the Argentine league during the 1995–96 season at age 15. = After the 1997–98 basketball season in the Argentine League, Scola moved to Spain and signed with Saski Baskonia. He was loaned to Gijón Baloncesto, where he helped the then Spanish League Second Division club achieve promotion to the Spanish League First Division. He then was loaned back to Gijón through the 1999–2000 season before arriving at Baskonia, where he played for seven seasons. = With Saski Baskonia, Scola reached the EuroLeague Finals in the 2000–01 season, and three consecutive EuroLeague Final Fours, between 2005 and 2007. His outstanding performances earned him an All-EuroLeague Second Team selection in 2005, as well as two All-EuroLeague First Team selections in 2006 and 2007. Although Scola did not win the EuroLeague championship with Baskonia, he did win with them every major Spanish League title, winning a Spanish ACB League championship in 2002, three Spanish King's Cups in 2002, 2004, 2006, and three Spanish Supercups in 2005, 2006, 2007. = In the summer of 2005, the San Antonio Spurs of the NBA (who drafted Scola in 2002) attempted to negotiate with Baskonia to buy out his contract. The teams settled on a number of over $3 million for the buyout of the contract. This made it difficult for Scola to join fellow Argentina national team member Manu Ginóbili in San Antonio because of the NBA's rule, which limits teams to paying no more than $500,000 of a player's buyout. Scola would have been responsible for paying Baskonia the remaining $2.5 million amount of the buyout. When the deal to buy out Scola's contract fell through, the Spurs instead signed an Argentine national team teammate and friend of Scola's, Fabricio Oberto. On July 12, 2007, the Spurs traded the rights to Scola, along with center-forward Jackie Butler, to the Houston Rockets, in return for Vassilis Spanoulis, a future second-round draft pick, and cash considerations. He signed with the Rockets soon after and his US$3.2 million buyout was completed a few days later. Scola signed a three-year contract with the Rockets at a salary of $9.5 million.

At 210 cm and 132 kg, Bateer was a strong center widely respected as an accomplished screen-setter and passer, despite being severely hindered over the years by a lack of speed. His prowess as a passer was put on full display during one of his earliest NBA games when he made six assists against the Chicago Bulls on March 30, 2002. As of his official retirement in 2015, Bateer holds three notable distinctions: he was the only Chinese player to have played in the NBA without being selected in any NBA draft until Cui Yongxi signed with the Brooklyn Nets in 2024; he was the first player of Asian descent to win an NBA championship; and he was the first Chinese player to have been on a title-winning roster, taking part in the San Antonio Spurs\' triumphant 2003 season. His compatriot Sun Yue also accomplished this achievement as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers when they won the NBA championship in 2009. Coincidentally, Bateer and Sun would win the 2014 CBA championship for the Beijing Ducks together, making them the first, and so far only, Chinese players to win both the NBA and CBA finals; a feat matched only by American player Eric Moreland in 2022. Bateer was also the first-ever Chinese player to start an NBA game when he joined the Denver Nuggets in 2002. Yao Ming would become the second Chinese player to do so later in that year and Wang Zhizhi, despite being the first-ever Chinese player to join the league, did not start in a game until years later. Brought up through the youth ranks by the Beijing Ducks, Mengke Bateer made his debut for China\'s national basketball team prior to the 1994 Asian Games, at the age of 18. Three years later, although a regular member of the playing rotation, he was removed from the national squad due to ""disciplinary problems"" as reported in the media. Often presented to the public as a filial son, Bateer would attempt several times over the course of his career to leave his teams, and return to his family. While training with China\'s national team in 1999, Bateer was invited to play in a pre-draft tournament held in Phoenix, where he suffered from jet lag and did not impress the scouts in attendance. He also made a brief appearance at another pre-draft venue, in Treviso, Italy. But he would have to wait several more years to play in the NBA, staying with the Ducks from the 1997–98 CBA season through the 2001–02 season, and earning MVP honors at the 2002 CBA All-Star Game. = In October 2001, Bateer joined the Denver Nuggets for the team\'s preseason training camp. He was dropped after two preseason games, but in March 2002, already deep into the 2001–02 NBA season, he rejoined the team, as the Nuggets were in desperate need of a player with big stature after trading Raef LaFrentz. This made him the second Chinese player to compete in the NBA after Wang Zhizhi, who had made his debut for the Dallas Mavericks a year earlier. He was also the first undrafted Chinese player in NBA history. Bateer played in Denver\'s final 25 games of the season, averaging 5.5 points while battling fouls from opponents. Due to the shortage of the players with big stature in the Nuggets roster, he also ended up in the starting 10 of those contests, becoming the first Chinese player to ever start an NBA game, as Wang never made it into the starting line-up during his time with the Mavericks. = In summer 2002, Bateer was traded to the Detroit Pistons, along with Don Reid, for Rodney White and a future first-round pick. But after an impressive show against Team USA at the 2002 FIBA World Championship in Indianapolis, where he scored 19 points (also leading China in scoring in five of seven games during the tournament) for a squad that also included the just-drafted Yao Ming, Team USA assistant coach Gregg Popovich, who was also the head coach of the San Antonio Spurs, decided to take a chance on Bateer and acquired him in exchange for a second-round pick. Despite playing only occasionally with the Spurs, Bateer was nonetheless a member of San Antonio\'s 2002–03 championship team. = The following season, Bateer signed as a free agent with the Toronto Raptors, but was transferred later in the 2003–04 NBA season to the Orlando Magic, who waived him three days later. In October 2004, the New York Knicks signed Bateer as a training camp invitee, but waived him prior to the start of the 2004–05 NBA season. After being waived by the Knicks, Bateer played for the Huntsville Flight of the National Basketball Development League, now known as the NBA G League, for a while, before deciding to return to China. = Mengke Bateer rejoined the Beijing Ducks in the Chinese Basketball Association in mid-February 2005, a couple of weeks before the end of the 2004–05 CBA season, and was named MVP of the 2005 CBA All-Star Game, which was held in Nanjing on March 7, after the regular season concluded. He scored a contest-best 28 points while leading the North to a 103–99 victory over the South. During the 2005–06 CBA season, Bateer helped Beijing win a then-franchise-best CBA North Division title, while averaging 25 points, 11 rebounds, and 5 assists per game. He was originally chosen to be named the league\'s Regular Season MVP, but he had the honor vacated due to a rule forbidding players who were slapped with suspensions from receiving any awards (earlier in the season, he incurred the heaviest fine in CBA history for arguing with a referee, and sat out two games as a result). Bateer then missed the 2006–07 CBA season due to injuries, and subsequently moved from the Ducks to the Xinjiang Flying Tigers, where he spent the next six years of his career. During his time in Xinjiang, he became the first player to ever ""three-peat"" as CBA Most Valuable Player, winning the honor in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The Flying Tigers also advanced to the CBA Finals in each of those years, but failed to win the title, falling to the Guangdong Southern Tigers on all three occasions. After a brief stint with the Sichuan Blue Whales in China\'s lower-tier NBL in summer 2013, just as the team was preparing join the CBA, Bateer returned to the Beijing Ducks for the 2013–14 CBA season. More of a role player by that point in his career, he nonetheless provided an occasionally useful presence in the front court for Beijing, and helped the Ducks win their second CBA title. Mengke Bateer competed for China in the Summer Olympic Games at Atlanta 1996, Sydney 2000, and Athens 2004. He represented the PRC at the 2002 FIBA World Championship in Indianapolis.', '606) and hit more threes (103 vs. 54) than he had in his first four seasons combined. Especially, Bowen earned himself a reputation as a defensive stopper. For his strong perimeter defense, he was voted into the All-Defensive Second Team. = 2001–03: First championship In the 2001–02 NBA season, Bowen was signed by the San Antonio Spurs. He joined a championship-caliber team, led by veteran Hall-of-Fame center David Robinson and young power forward Tim Duncan, complemented by talented role players like Steve Smith, Malik Rose, Antonio Daniels and point guards Terry Porter and Tony Parker. Bowen established himself as a starter, beginning in each of his 59 regular-season games. In that season, Bowen received his first of several fines: he had to pay $7,500 for kicking Wally Szczerbiak in the face during a March 1, 2002 game. In the 2002 NBA playoffs, Bowen started in all 10 Spurs playoffs games, where the team eventually succumbed to the Los Angeles Lakers. For his feats, Bowen earned himself his second All-Defensive Second Team nomination, although some peers and sports analysts accused him of being a ""dirty"" defender. In the next season, Bowen started in all 82 regular-season games for the second time in his career and averaged 7.1 points, 2.9 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 31.3 minutes per game. Again, he was voted into the All-Defensive Second Team and was a member of the Spurs team which won the 2003 NBA Finals. At age 31, the one-time journeyman Bowen had won his first championship ring as a starter. He achieved a rare instance of his 3-point percentage (44%) being higher than his free throw percentage (40%) on 2.8 attempts from three per game and 1.1 FTA, while meeting statistical minimum requirements. It is thought of as possible as a result of Bowen focusing his shot selection on corner threes and rarely straying to shoot anywhere else. In the following three seasons, Bowen established a reputation as one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA, earning three straight All-Defensive First Team elections and ending as runner-up in the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award votings twice, losing to post defender Ben Wallace. 2003–04: Back-to-back chase Having established himself as the premier defensive backcourt player, Bowen\'s effective, but hard-nosed style of play came under discussion. In particular, rival guards Vince Carter and Steve Francis accused him of encroaching into their landing space during their jumpshot. Inside Hoops columnist M.J. Darnell commented: ""They\'re whining because Bruce Bowen has frustrated, upset, hurt or angered them in some way.... He just plays tough, physical defense, does not play with any intent to injure, but isn\'t afraid to get in someone\'s grill"". Bowen\'s defensive style failed to help this Spurs squad repeat in the 2004 NBA playoffs, as the team was eventually defeated 4–2 by the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semi-Finals. 2005–07: Second and third championships Bowen and the Spurs bounced back and won the NBA title in 2005, defeating the Detroit Pistons. The Spurs could not win back-to-back titles, however, and bowed out 4–3 in a seven-game series against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2006 NBA playoffs. As a testament to his controversial style of play, Bowen picked up a $10,000 NBA fine for kicking Ray Allen in the back during a March 2006 game. In the 2007 NBA playoffs, the Spurs played against the Phoenix Suns, and Bowen became the center of controversy. His knee contacted Phoenix Suns guard Steve Nash\'s groin, knocking Nash to the floor. Also in that series, forward–center Amar\'e Stoudemire accused Bowen of kicking him during a game, but the NBA reviewed and dismissed the claim. ESPN columnist Bill Simmons commented that Bowen was ""a cheap player who\'s going to seriously hurt someone someday"", but Simmons also acknowledged that Bowen ""ultimately makes his team better."" The Spurs went on to beat the Suns, and Bowen\'s defense contributed to the Spurs winning their fourth championship in the 2007 NBA Finals. 2007–09: Final years in San Antonio In the 2007–08 NBA season, the now 36-year-old veteran Bowen played and started in 81 of 82 regular season games, earning his fifth straight nomination in the NBA All-Defensive First Team. Ever controversial, Bowen was fined $7,000 and suspended for one game for kicking Chris Paul after Paul had fallen to the floor during a March 12, 2008 game. Bowen finished as the runner-up behind Marcus Camby for the league\'s defensive player of the year award. In the 2008 NBA playoffs, Bowen was unable to stop Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant, who averaged 28.3 points and helped L.A. beat the Spurs in five games. Bowen started in every Spurs regular season and playoff game from 2001 to 2008. The 2008–09 NBA season was to be Bowen\'s last with the Spurs. Although he played in 80 regular-season games, he was no longer a starter as was the case in the previous seven San Antonio campaigns. His minutes were also greatly reduced (from 30+ to 18.9 per game), although his shooting numbers remained consistent. The Spurs went into the 2009 NBA playoffs with a 54–28 record and as the third seed. With influential shooting guard Manu Ginóbili out injured, the Spurs got off to a bad start to the series and eventually lost 4–1 against the Dallas Mavericks, bowing out of the playoffs in the first round for the first time since 2000. On June 23, 2009, Bowen was traded along with Kurt Thomas and Fabricio Oberto to the Milwaukee Bucks for Richard Jefferson. He was released on July 31, 2009, and retired on September 3, 2009. On March 21, 2012, the Spurs retired Bowen\'s #12 jersey. Bowen\'s jersey was the seventh retired by the Spurs. With Bowen\'s permission, the Spurs reissued the number 12 for free agent LaMarcus Aldridge in 2015.

With the LNB club Atenas, in his native Argentina, Oberto began playing professionally in 1993, and later played overseas with teams in Spain and Greece. In 2005, Oberto signed with the San Antonio Spurs, a team of the American National Basketball Association (NBA), and won a championship with the Spurs in 2007. He is also a former member of the senior Argentina national basketball team, with whom he won two Olympic medals, including a gold medal in 2004. He was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2019. = At age 17, Oberto went to a trial at Atenas de Córdoba, one of the most important basketball clubs in Argentina, and was selected to start the following year, and started playing professionally later that year. In 1998, after being chosen MVP of the finals of the Argentine league, he transferred to the Greek League club Olympiacos, starting his EuroLeague experience that would take him to the Spanish League's Tau Cerámica a year later. After 3 seasons with TAU, he moved to Pamesa Valencia in 2002. = In 2005, after voiding his contract with Pamesa, Oberto signed a three-year, US$7.5 million contract with the San Antonio Spurs of the NBA, where he joined fellow Argentine Manu Ginóbili. He kept with jersey number 7, the same kit number he used with the Argentina national basketball team. Oberto was the oldest rookie in Spurs history at the age of 31. During the first year of his NBA stint, Oberto was no longer the key player he had been in Europe, playing less than nine minutes per game on average. He nonetheless was very satisfied with his role on the Spurs, a perennial championship contender. In his second NBA season, Oberto became more of a factor in the Spurs rotation, starting in some games and getting his first double-double on November 8, 2006, when he scored 22 points and pulled down 10 rebounds. He also became a pivotal player for the Spurs during the 2006–07 Western Conference Finals, averaging 31 minutes and 14 points in the first two games of the series. Oberto won an NBA championship with the Spurs in 2007. On June 23, 2009, Oberto was traded to the Detroit Pistons as a part of a three-team trade among Pistons, Spurs and the Milwaukee Bucks, which included Richard Jefferson.

Jackson\'s strong play, and particularly his fearlessness against the Suns\' Cedric Ceballos, is largely what led to team president Danny Ainge drafting him months later. = Jackson was selected 42nd overall in the 1997 NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns, yet did not play as he was waived by the team on October 30. Following this development, Jackson then saw action in six games with the La Crosse Bobcats over two on-and-off seasons in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), in which he averaged 2.7 points in 12.7 minutes per game. Additionally, Jackson played four games in 1998 with the Sydney Kings in Australia\'s National Basketball League. Continuing his basketball journey, Jackson played professionally in Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. Throughout the spring and summer of 2000, Jackson played in those Latin American countries, with the Dominican Republic teams San Carlos and Pueblo Nuevo and the Venezuelan team the Marinos. In the 1999 season in Venezuela, Jackson played 48 games and averaged 22.8 points (third in the league), 3.9 assists and 3 steals per game, shooting 42.6% from three (second in the league). = Jackson did not play an NBA game until the 2000–01 season with the New Jersey Nets, officially deemed his rookie season. He appeared in 77 games (including 40 starts), in which he averaged 8.2 points per game, and established a close friendship with star point guard Stephon Marbury. The Nets did not have interest in retaining him. = Before the 2001–2002 NBA season, Jackson was signed by the San Antonio Spurs. He was hampered by injuries, missing 45 games. Former assistant coach Mike Brown stated: ""The first year we had him in San Antonio, he was on the (injured reserve) most of the year. At first, he didn\'t understand why because he probably was the most talented player we had on that team, but he needed to mature a little bit so we stuck him there to see how he would respond. He was the best teammate on our team that first year. He was juiced at practice ready to play and compete and make the starters better, and it carried over into his second year when he got his opportunity to get out onto the floor and prove he could be a vital part of the organization."" His season averages were 3.9 points and 1.1 rebounds, logging approximately 9.9 minutes per game. During the 2002–2003 NBA season, Jackson became a key member of the Spurs. Appearing in 80 games (58 starts), his season averages were 11.8 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 28.2 minutes per game. During the team\'s run in the 2003 NBA Playoffs, Jackson proved to be a vital asset and helped the Spurs win their second NBA title, averaging 12.8 points per game during the playoffs –- the team\'s 3rd leading scorer. Jackson\'s first foray into the playoffs produced variable results in terms of individual performances. Through the course of the postseason, Jackson vacillated between fourth quarter heroics and clutch shooting (elimination games of the Western Conference Finals versus the Dallas Mavericks and NBA Finals versus the New Jersey Nets) and uneven, mistake-prone play (26 turnovers in the 6-game championship series). = In 2003, Jackson became a free agent during the offseason and expected to parlay his success with the Spurs into a long-term contract. After rejecting an initial offer by the Spurs, he and his agent were criticized by sports media for miscalculating the market. Eventually, Jackson agreed to a 2-year contract with the Atlanta Hawks. Registering his best professional season to date, Jackson established season averages of 18.1 points, 4.6 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game in 80 total games (78 starts). On March 12, against the Washington Wizards, Jackson scored a career-best 42 points. In the 29 games following the All-Star Break, Jackson averaged 24.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 2.2 steals per game. During this stretch, he was the NBA\'s 6th leading scorer. Following the 2003–04 NBA season, he was traded to the Indiana Pacers for power forward Al Harrington (who finished 2nd place in Sixth Man of the Year voting), after signing a 6-year, $38.3 million contract. = During his first season as a member of the Indiana Pacers in the 2004–05 NBA season, Jackson tallied averages of 18.7 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game. On November 19, 2004, during The Malice at the Palace, Jackson was involved in a brawl with fans in the stands at The Palace of Auburn Hills. In the aftermath, Jackson was suspended for 30 games without pay, thereby losing $1.7 million in salary. He was also put on probation for a year, fined $250, and ordered to undergo anger management classes and perform 60 hours of community service.']",Devin Brown won an NBA championship as a member of the San Antonio Spurs in 2005.,2005,1.0,0.9612034115214422,0.799612887105618,0.75,0.6999388088443792,0.799755235377517

The Kings lost in four games to the top-seeded Seattle SuperSonics in the first round, with Grant averaging 9.8 points per game for the series. He signed a five-year, $29 million contract, but due to injuries appeared in only 24 games in the 1996–1997 season, and the Kings did not make the playoffs. = Grant opted out of the deal following the 1997 season to sign a six-year, $56 million deal with the Portland Trail Blazers. In his first year with the Trail Blazers he started in 49 of 61 games as the team made the playoffs but lost in the first round to the Los Angeles Lakers 3 games to 1. Grant averaged 13.2 points and 10.7 rebounds a game for the series. The 1998–1999 season was shortened to 50 games because of a league lockout, and Grant started 46 of 48 games with a scoring average of 11.5 points a game and a team high 9.8 rebounds per game. The Trail Blazers won the Pacific Division, swept the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the playoffs and defeated the previous Western Conference Champion Utah Jazz in six games in the second round. In the Western Conference Finals, the Trail Blazers were swept by the league-leading San Antonio Spurs. Grant started all 13 playoff games and averaged 13.2 points with 9.2 rebounds. Prior to the 1999–2000 season, Portland acquired veteran all-star Scottie Pippen, and coach Mike Dunleavy decided to use Grant as a reserve behind rising all-star Rasheed Wallace, who would go on to have a career year during the season as the Trail Blazers won 59 games and the second seed in the Western Conference. Portland opened the playoffs with a 3–1 first-round win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, with Grant and Wallace both being used as defensive options against Kevin Garnett. Grant was used in a similar fashion against Karl Malone and the Utah Jazz in the second round, with Portland advancing in five games. In the Western Conference Finals, the Trail Blazers faced the Los Angeles Lakers led by Pippen\'s former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson and the duo of Shaquille O\'Neal and Kobe Bryant. The teams split the first two games before the Lakers took games 3 and 4 to take a 3–1 series lead, but Portland responded with a win on the road in game 5 and a home win in the sixth game to set up a seventh game with a trip to the NBA Finals on the line. Despite taking a double-digit lead into the fourth quarter, the Lakers rallied and won the game, eliminating Portland. Grant averaged 5.4 points and 5.8 rebounds throughout the 2000 playoff run. After two years as the starting PF and one year as the Blazers\' number one big man off the bench, Grant once again opted out of his deal to become a free agent, hoping to land a starting job elsewhere. Grant made an appearance (albeit as an in game model) in a memorable Sega Dreamcast commercial in 1999 where he was seen talking to Sonic the Hedgehog character Tails. After the two-tailed fox said to Grant, ""Brian, you\'re going to get roofed."", Grant replied with, ""Shut up, quadruped."" = In the summer of 2000 Grant signed a 7-year $86 million deal with the Miami Heat, despite coming off season averages of 7.5 ppg and 5.5 rpg. The deal raised eyebrows, but Heat President and GM Pat Riley insisted that Grant was the missing piece to the Heat\'s championship puzzle, along with other recently acquired players Eddie Jones and Anthony Mason. Weeks before the start of the season Miami\'s all-star center Alonzo Mourning was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease forcing Riley to play Grant at center despite usually playing at the power forward position. Grant responded by putting up a career season of 15.2 ppg, 8.8 rpg, and a career high 79.7% at the foul line. Miami won 50 games, and Mourning returned to the team in late March, but were swept in the first round by the younger Charlotte Hornets. Grant averaged 10 points and 8 rebounds for the series. In the 2001–2002 season, with the anticipated return of Mourning to the lineup, Grant returned to his natural power forward position. Grant started in 72 games for Miami averaging 9.3 points and 8.0 rebounds a game for the season, but the Heat failed to reach the postseason. The next year signaled a rebuilding era for the team, as the Heat won just 25 games with Grant averaging 10.3 points a game along with a career high 10.2 rebounds, which placed him at fifth in the league in rebounds per game. He also finished the season 4th in total rebounds, 5th in defensive rebounds, and 10th in the league in field goal percentage at .509 percent, all personal bests. The Heat once again found themselves in the lottery, and would select Dwyane Wade in the draft to join sophomore Caron Butler before acquiring free agent Lamar Odom in the offseason. Alonzo Mourning, who did not play in the 2003 season, left the team and signed with the New Jersey Nets, leaving Grant as the team\'s best option at the center position.

He played collegiately at Villanova University. He was selected seventh overall in the 2006 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, but was immediately traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, and later traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves where he began his career. Foye attended East Side High School in Newark, where he was selected as New Jersey Player of the Year, before being recruited by Jay Wright and Villanova. Considered a four-star recruit by Scout.com, Foye was listed as the No. 7 shooting guard and the No. 37 player in the nation in 2002. Foye, along with Allan Ray, Curtis Sumpter, and Jason Fraser were proclaimed as the players to lead the Villanova Wildcats back to a championship. Foye and Ray reached the Elite Eight of the 2006 NCAA Tournament, playing with the other three starters in the four-guard offense (Kyle Lowry, Mike Nardi and Will Sheridan), while Sumpter was sidelined as a medical redshirt with a knee injury. Foye's college career was productive and eventful, but his senior season was by far the best statistically. In the 2005 NCAA Tournament, Foye averaged 20 points in three games, before a heartbreaking loss to #1 seed and eventual national champion North Carolina in which Foye scored a career-high 28 points. He was named third-team all Big East that year. In 2006, Foye won the honor of Big East Player of the Year, beating out teammate Allan Ray, Connecticut star Rudy Gay and the league's leading scorer Quincy Douby of Rutgers. Villanova tied for the Big East regular season championship with Uconn and split their two games with the Huskies, winning the one played at home, in what some called the biggest Villanova win in over 20 years. Their final Big East regular season record was 14–2 in what some called the toughest conference ever. Overall, their record was 28–5. In the NCAA Tournament in 2006, Foye continued to be Villanova's biggest scoring threat. He had 24 points in their second-round game against Arizona in a winning effort. Foye scored a team-high 25 points in his final game as a Wildcat, on March 26, 2006, a 75–62 loss to Florida in the Elite Eight. As a senior Foye averaged 20.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.4 steals, and 0.6 blocks, with a field goal percentage of 41.1%. = On June 28, 2006, Foye was selected seventh overall in the 2006 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, but was immediately traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, and later traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves. He entered his rookie year on a team that already had six guards on its roster. Off-season free-agent acquisition Mike James was slated to start at point guard, Foye's most likely position in the NBA, with Ricky Davis at small forward and Rashad McCants at shooting guard. This left Foye to battle for minutes on a bench full of guards. In November, Foye's first month as a professional basketball player, Timberwolves coach Dwane Casey only gave Foye an average of 14.6 minutes per game. Foye, however, was productive whenever he was given minutes. He scored in double digits in each of the four games he was given 20 or more minutes of playing time. In December 2007, Foye's minutes per game average increased to 19.6 and he scored in double digits in half of the T-Wolves' games. However, after Dwane Casey's firing after the Twolves' 40th game (when they had a record of 20–20), the Twolves struggled, yet the young star played well when given minutes. In March, Foye saw nearly 24 minutes of playing time a night, and in April saw almost 27 minutes a night to perform. Foye played all 82 games (12 starts) in his rookie season and averaged 22.9 minutes, 10.1 points, 2.7 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 0.65 steals, and 0.3 blocks per game. Among rookies, he ranked fifth in scoring (10.1 ppg), eighth in field goal percentage (43.4%), third in 3-point shooting percentage (37%), third in free throw shooting percentage (85%), 5th in assists (2.8 apg) and 9th in steals (0.65 spg). He was one of the most consistent rookie performers and was selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. On December 23, 2008, Foye pulled down 16 rebounds to set a career high and break the team record of 15 for a guard set by Isaiah Rider in 1996. Foye also had 26 points and 1 assist in the 99–93 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. = On June 23, 2009, Foye, along with Mike Miller, was traded to the Washington Wizards for Oleksiy Pecherov, Etan Thomas, Darius Songaila, and a first round draft pick. On January 9, 2010, Foye was fined $10,000 by the Washington Wizards for participating in Gilbert Arenas' antics before a game on January 5, 2010, against the Philadelphia 76ers. Arenas was being investigated for a prior incident involving guns in the Wizards' locker room, but made light of the accusations by pointing his finger at his teammates, as if he were shooting them. His teammates were photographed smiling and laughing with him. = On July 8, 2010, Foye was signed by the Los Angeles Clippers. Foye started the year as a backup, but moved into the starting rotation following an injury to Eric Gordon and trade of Baron Davis. On February 11, 2011, he scored 32 points with seven assists and two steals while shooting 50 percent from the field in a 99–92 loss to the Boston Celtics. In his first season in LA, Foye developed chemistry with Rookie of the Year Blake Griffin, establishing himself as LA's shooting guard heading into the 2011–12 season. However a busy lockout-delayed offseason saw the Clippers acquire All-Stars Chris Paul and Chauncey Billups, moving Foye back to a reserve role. He would end up starting most off the year and all 11 playoff games after Billups sustained a season-ending injury, averaging 11 points, two rebounds and two assists a game. = On July 25, 2012, Foye agreed to terms with the Utah Jazz. During the one season Foye played for the Jazz, he set the franchise record for most 3-pointers made in a year, making 178 out of 434 shots (with a shooting percentage of 41%). = On July 10, 2013, Foye was traded to the Denver Nuggets as part of a three-team trade involving the Jazz and the Golden State Warriors. On February 3, 2014, Foye hit the first game-winning shot of his eight-year NBA career, making a 30-foot three-pointer as time expired to claim a 116–115 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. On December 23, 2015, Foye scored a season-high 31 points and made seven three-pointers in a 104–96 win over the Phoenix Suns. = On February 18, 2016, Foye was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for D.

Smith were involved in a minor car accident. Neither player was injured in the collision. The only information released by the team was that the car Smith was driving belonged to Anthony. Three days later, Anthony recorded his first career triple-double, with 31 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, in a 113–108 loss to the Phoenix Suns. When the reserves for the Western Conference All-Star team were announced, Anthony was not included on the roster. However, with Yao Ming and Carlos Boozer out with injuries, NBA commissioner David Stern chose Anthony as a replacement (along with Josh Howard). Anthony scored 20 points with nine rebounds in his All-Star debut. Anthony was the first Denver Nugget to be named an All-Star since Antonio McDyess in 2001. Anthony won Player of the Week honors three times during the season (November 20–26; November 27 – December 3; and February 5–11), and received Player of the Month honors for April. Anthony finished the season as the league\'s second leading scorer behind Bryant, with an average of 28.9 points, while adding 6.0 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.2 steals per game. He was named to All-NBA Third Team for the second straight year. 2007–08 season On January 24, 2008, Anthony was named to his second consecutive NBA All-Star Game—his first as a starter. He finished as the leading vote-getter among Western Conference forwards (1,723,701 votes) and second in overall voting to Kobe Bryant (2,004,940 votes) among all Western Conference players. On February 8, Anthony scored a then career-high 49 points in a 111–100 home win over the Washington Wizards. He had a field goal percentage of .760 on a 19-of-25 shooting effort, and his shooting percentage was the second highest in the last 13 years for a player who took 25 or more shots in a game (Bryant was first with a .769 field goal percentage on a 20-of-26 shooting effort, in a 99–94 road victory over the Houston Rockets on December 21, 2000). On March 27, in a home win over the Dallas Mavericks, Anthony scored his 9,000th career point. He played in 77 games during the regular season, finishing as the NBA\'s fourth-leading scorer with 25.7 points per game, and had career-highs in rebounds per game (7.4) and steals per game (1.3). He tied his career-high in blocks per game (0.5), and ended the season with 3.4 assists per game, which was the second-best mark of his career. The Nuggets finished the 2007–08 season with exactly 50 wins (50–32 overall record, tied for the third-best all-time Nuggets record since the team officially joined the NBA in 1976), following a 120–111 home victory over the Memphis Grizzlies in the last game of the season. It was the first time since the 1987–88 NBA season that the Nuggets finished with at least 50 wins in a season. Denver ended up as the eighth seed in the Western Conference of the 2008 Playoffs, and their 50 wins marked the highest win total for an eighth seed in NBA history. It also meant that for the first time in NBA history, all eight playoff seeds in a conference had at least 50 wins. The Nuggets faced the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers (57–25 overall record) in the First Round of the Playoffs. The seven games separating the Nuggets overall record and the Lakers overall record is the closest margin between an eighth seed and a top seed since the NBA went to a 16-team playoff format in 1983–84. The Lakers swept the Nuggets in four games, marking the second time in NBA history that a 50-win team was swept in a best-of-seven playoff series in the First Round. For the series, Anthony averaged 22.5 points, 9.5 rebounds (playoff career-high), 2.0 assists and 0.5 steals per game. 2008–09 season The 2008–09 campaign began with Allen Iverson being traded to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for guard Chauncey Billups. On December 10, 2008, in a 116–105 home win over the Timberwolves, Anthony tied George Gervin for the most points scored in one quarter in NBA history by scoring 33 points in the third quarter. Gervin had set the record when he was competing against David Thompson for the scoring title on the last day of the 1977–78 season. Anthony shot 12 of 15 (80%) in the third quarter and finished the game with 45 points, 11 rebounds, three assists, and four steals. The record was broken in January 2015 by Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors. On January 4, 2009, Anthony broke a bone in his hand in a game against the Indiana Pacers. He opted to have the hand splinted rather than have surgery; his recovery time was estimated at three to four weeks. He had already missed three games in late December with a sore elbow. Anthony returned from injury and to the Nuggets starting lineup on January 30, 2009, in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats in which he scored 19 points. Anthony was suspended for one game by the Nuggets for staying on the court and refusing to leave the game after coach George Karl benched him during a game against the Pacers. The Nuggets won the Northwest Division and placed second in the Western Conference, finishing the season with a franchise record-tying 54 wins (54–28 overall). Anthony averaged 22.8 points per game and made a career-high 37.1% of his shots from three-point range. After losing in five straight playoff appearances (2004–2008), on April 29, 2009, Anthony won his first playoff series when the Nuggets beat the New Orleans Hornets at home 107–86 where Anthony finished with a playoff career-high 34 points and four steals. In a post-game conference, Anthony said ""Yeah, finally... Took me 5 years to get that gorilla off my back, it\'s a great feeling."" The Nuggets beat the Hornets in five games in the First Round of the playoffs and proceeded to beat the Dallas Mavericks 4–1 in the conference semifinals with Anthony scoring 30 points in a solid game five performance. In the third game of the semifinals, Anthony made a last second three-point shot to give the Nuggets the win after being down by two points (103–105). Denver advanced to the Conference finals for the first time since 1985 but was eliminated, 4–2, by the eventual NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers on his birthday. Anthony was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the third time in his career. 2009–10 season In the opening two games of the 2009–10 season, Anthony totaled 71 points, scoring 30 points in the home opener and 41 the next night, in wins against division rivals Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers respectively. Anthony became one of three players in the Nuggets\' history to open with 70 or more points through two games—tied with Nick Van Exel with 71 points—surpassed only by Alex English who did it twice, in 1985 (79) and 1988 (74). It was also only the second time since 1987 that the Nuggets started the season 2–0. In their third game, Anthony scored 42 points. It was the first time they went 3–0 since 1985. In the month of November, Anthony was named the NBA player of the week and Western Conference Player of the Month, leading the Nuggets to a 12–5 start. In the fifteenth regular season game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Anthony entered the game leading the league in points per game (30.2) and was the only player in the league to score at least 20 points in every game. He finished the game with 22 points which was his fifteenth consecutive game with at least 20 points breaking the previous franchise record of 14 straight set by English. The following game, Anthony scored a career-high 50 points in a home game against the New York Knicks while teammate Chauncey Billups added 32 points in the game, making them only the third duo in NBA history to score at least 50 and 30 points respectively. Two days later, Anthony scored a total of 32 points. On January 21, 2010, Anthony was named as a starter for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game leading the Western Conference ballots in votes for forwards. This was Anthony\'s third All-Star appearance and second as a starter. He finished the game with a team-high 27 points and 10 rebounds. In the team\'s first game after the All-Star Game, the Nuggets visited the Cleveland Cavaliers in a highly anticipated game with the Cavaliers having a 13-game winning streak. While LeBron James posted a triple-double of 43 points, 13 rebounds and 15 assists, Anthony compiled 40 points, six rebounds and seven assists in an overtime win as Anthony nailed a jumper over the outstretched arms of James with just 1.9 seconds left in the game, ending the Cavaliers\' win streak. On March 26, 2010, Anthony made a game-winning shot at the buzzer, after missing his first attempt, against the Toronto Raptors. The Nuggets concluded the 2009–10 regular season with a 53–29 record and the Northwest Division title for the second straight season facing the Utah Jazz in the First Round. In Game 1, Anthony scored a playoff-career-high 42 points. This also matched a franchise-playoff high for scoring in a single playoff game, tied with Alex English. Anthony was named to the All-NBA Second Team for the first time in his career. 2010–11 season The 2010–11 season began with speculation that Anthony had requested a trade. Anthony refused to sign a proposed contract extension. Sources reported that Anthony\'s preferred destination was the New York Knicks, with other teams such as the New Jersey Nets, Houston Rockets and Atlanta Hawks said to be interested. Anthony\'s trade request was not initially fulfilled, and he began the season on the Nuggets\' roster. On November 15, 2010, Anthony had 20 points and a career-high 22 rebounds for the first 20–20 game of his career against the Phoenix Suns. He also a hit game-winning jumper at the buzzer against the Bulls on November 26, 2010. = 2010–11 season On February 22, 2011, Anthony, along with point guard Chauncey Billups, was traded to the New York Knicks in a multi-player deal also involving the Minnesota Timberwolves. Anthony immediately signed a three-year, $65 million extension through the 2014–15 season and chose to wear number 7 with the Knicks, as his former number 15 was retired by the Knicks in honor of Earl Monroe and Dick McGuire. He chose that number because his son was born on March 7, and because 7 was the result of subtracting his number in Denver, 15, from his high school number of 22. Anthony\'s first game with the Knicks was a 114–108 win against the Milwaukee Bucks in which he scored 27 points and had 10 rebounds and an assist. After Anthony\'s acquisition, the Knicks qualified for the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference and were matched up against the Boston Celtics. During the series, the Knicks struggled with injuries as Amar\'e Stoudemire and Billups went down. In game two of the NBA playoffs in Boston, Anthony tied a playoff career high with 42 points and also had 17 rebounds and six assists in a Knicks loss. The Knicks fell to the Boston Celtics in four games in the First Round of the playoffs. 2011–12 season The 2011–12 season brought new expectations, as the season would be Anthony\'s first full season as a Knick. The Knicks struggled throughout the season, as injuries derailed the team. Anthony himself missed 11 games; during this stretch, the Knicks inserted Jeremy Lin as the team\'s starting point guard. This led to a historic stretch of games by Lin, and a period of basketball hysteria known as Linsanity. However, the team found themselves with an 18–24 record, leading to the resignation of coach Mike D\'Antoni. Anthony was assumed to have a role in the coach\'s departure, as he was not a good fit in D\'Antoni\'s high paced offense. Mike Woodson took over for D\'Antoni; this led to an improvement in Anthony\'s play, as he was more suited for Woodson\'s halfcourt offense. On Easter Sunday, Anthony had arguably his best game in a Knicks uniform as he scored 43 points and hit two clutch three-pointers in a victory over Chicago. Under Woodson, the Knicks finished the season at 18–6, a vast improvement from the 18–24 record they had under D\'Antoni. The Knicks qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, and faced off against the eventual champions, the Miami Heat.', 'He shot 0.347 from the field, 0.238 from 3-point range, and 0.68 from the free throw line, playing an average of 9.4 minutes per game.

This made them only the third duo in NBA history to score at least 30 and 50 points respectively. On February 5, 2010, Billups set a career high in points with a 39-point performance in a road win over the Los Angeles Lakers with 27 of them coming from 9 three-pointers.

In late June 1992, Danilović entered the NBA draft where he was taken in the second round by Golden State Warriors as the 43rd overall pick. He eventually decided to stay in Europe, signing with sports agent Mira Poljo, an established agent with good connections in Italy through the Interperformances sports agency. She soon referred him to her colleague Luciano Capicchioni. Danilović eventually signed a lucrative contract with Knorr Bologna paying him approximately $900,000 per season. = Arriving in the Italian city of Bologna, with the club Virtus and with an aura of the EuroLeague champion and EuroLeague Final Four MVP, big things were expected of 22-year-old Danilović. Earlier that summer, the club went through an ownership change with businessman Alfredo Cazzola acquiring it. 1992–93 season: Italian champions, Euroleague struggles Coached by Ettore Messina and playing alongside point guard Roberto Brunamonti and a center line of Bill Wennington and Augusto Binelli, Danilović led the team to the top of the standings in the regular season with a 24–6 record, ahead of former teammate Saša Đorđević\'s Philips Milano and reigning league champions Benetton Treviso, led by Toni Kukoč, before sweeping through the playoffs without a single loss, overcoming Olimpia Pistoia, Clear Cantù, and finally Kukoč\'s Treviso in the playoff final series to win the Italian League title in impressive style. Dueling with his old Yugoslav League nemesis, Danilović got the better of Kukoč this time. Establishing himself as Virtus\'s undisputed leader, Danilović averaged a combined 23.7 points per game over the course of the regular season and playoffs. In contrast to the domestic league, EuroLeague success proved elusive. The campaign started in early October, but it was the opening group stage game on October 29, 1992, that brought Danilović an uncomfortable away trip to play against Cibona in Zagreb. He thus became the very first Serb to play a competitive game in the newly independent Croatia after the breakup of Yugoslavia while the wars in the former Yugoslavia continued. Rattled by playing in an extremely hostile atmosphere, Danilović had a poor shooting night making 5 of 15 field goals, good for only 12 points as Virtus lost by 16. Talking about the Zagreb experience, later in 1996, Danilović said: ""Traveling to the game I assumed there would be issues, but I certainly didn\'t expect that much hate. Eight thousand people showed up just to insult a Serb. Getting through that game was not easy at all for me and you can tell from my stats. Even their player Franjo Arapović as well as their head coach Aco Petrović were hostile before the game even started wanting to hurl abuse at me, but I managed to put them in their place once we got out on the court. Also I think the two of them realized they had a rematch to play in Bologna in a few months so they didn\'t want to antagonize me too much"". In the rematch at home in January 1993, an inspired Danilović led the way with 9 of 12 field goal shooting and 23 points as Virtus jumped out to an early lead, and building on the early advantage to win by 40. Making it out of the group stage in the last qualifying spot with a 6–6 record meant that in their quarter-final best-of-three series Virtus would face the top-placed team from the other group – the formidable Real Madrid squad led by Arvydas Sabonis. Virtus got blown out by Real, losing the first game at PalaDozza by 20 points with Danilović scoring 4 points, while five days later in Madrid, Real finished the job with another convincing victory, this time by 21 points. 1993–94 season: Another league title In summer 1993, coach Messina left the club to take the head coaching position at the Italian national team with returning coach Alberto Bucci coming in as his replacement at Bologna.', 'None of the deals were completed.

Following the disappointing start, Iverson reportedly demanded a trade from the Sixers (which he denied). As a result, Iverson was told he would not play in any more games. During the following game against the Washington Wizards, which was televised nationally on ESPN, Sixers Chairman Ed Snider confirmed the trade rumors by stating ""We\'re going to trade him.

Jokić's late-season surge also saw him become the first player since Chamberlain to register at least 35 points and 12 rebounds in five straight games. For games played in March and April, Jokić was named Western Conference Player of the Month, for the second time in the season, and fourth time in his career, surpassing Carmelo Anthony and Alex English for most such honors in Nuggets franchise history. Jokić finished the regular season averaging 27.1 points, 13.8 rebounds, and 7.9 assists on 58.3%/33.7%/81.0% shooting splits, and led the Nuggets to a 48–34 winning record for the last direct playoff spot (No. 6) despite Denver's second and third best players missing nearly the entire season. He became the first player in NBA history to average over 25 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists in a season and the first to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and field goal percentage. Jokić was the only player in the NBA this season to finish in the top 10 in points per game, rebounds per game and assists per game. His advanced metrics were historically great, garnering the highest single-season player efficiency rating in NBA history at 32.85. Jokić also led the NBA in win shares, offensive win shares, box plus-minus, value over replacement player, total rebounds, double-doubles (66), and triple-doubles (19). On April 21, in Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, Jokić logged 37 points, 18 rebounds, five assists, and three steals in a 118–113 loss to the Warriors. Three days later in Game 4, he recorded 37 points, eight rebounds, and six assists in a 126–121 victory. Denver would go on to lose to Golden State in five games despite Jokić's 30-point, 19-rebound, eight-assist, and two-block outing in the 102–98 close-out loss. He scored 12 of his 30 points in the final four minutes of the game."", ""Jaylon La Rone Tyson (born December 2, 2002) is an American basketball player for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Texas Longhorns, the Texas Tech Red Raiders, and the California Golden Bears. Tyson was born on December 2, 2002, and grew up in Plano, Texas. He attended John Paul II High School in Plano and helped the team win their first state championship in his junior year, during which he averaged 23.3 points, 5.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. Tyson then helped them reach the state semifinals with a 26–2 record as a senior, being named the district most valuable player and a first-team all-state selection while averaging 22.3 points, 4.7 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 2.1 steals per game. Ranked the 34th-best recruit in the 2021 class by Rivals, he committed to playing college basketball for Texas after having flipped from Texas Tech. In his first year at Texas in the 2021–22 season, Tyson appeared in eight games, averaging 6.9 minutes and 1.8 points per game. He then entered the NCAA transfer portal. Tyson ultimately committed to play for Texas Tech, whom he had previously committed to play for in high school before flipping to Texas. Tyson started 31 games for Texas Tech in 2022–23, the third-most on the team, and averaged 10.7 points and 6.1 rebounds per game. He ranked eighth in the Big 12 Conference for rebounds. He entered the transfer portal for a second time after the season, citing “racist” comments made by head coach Mark Adams, who was later suspended and resigned. Mark Adams did not deny that racially insensitive comments were made, but did say the comments were linked to a Bible verse. He committed to the California Golden Bears. In October 2023, the NCAA initially denied Tyson's eligibility waiver for being a two-time transfer, despite Tyson alleging discrimination, which the NCAA rules mentioned as valid criteria for an eligibility waiver.

What event led to Michael Jordan becoming a grandfather in 2019?,"[""It was completed in 1995. Jordan listed the mansion for sale in 2012. He also owns homes in North Carolina and Jupiter Island, Florida. On July 21, 2006, a judge in Cook County, Illinois, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5 million in a breach of contract claim. Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret. Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991; a DNA test showed that Jordan was not the father of the child. Jordan proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011, and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church. It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together. On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel. In 2019, Jordan became a grandfather when his daughter Jasmine gave birth to a son, whose father is professional basketball player Rakeem Christmas. Gambling During the 1993 NBA playoffs, Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the night before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks. The previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses, and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course. In 2005, Jordan discussed his gambling with Ed Bradley of 60 Minutes and admitted that he made reckless decisions. Jordan stated: Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive?"", 'He has two older brothers, James Jr. and Larry, as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named Roslyn. Jordan and his siblings were raised Methodist. In 1968, the family moved to Wilmington, North Carolina. Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School, where he played basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year, but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short. Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney\'s junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games. The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously. Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play. He also adopted his signature jersey number, 23. As a senior, he was selected for the 1981 McDonald\'s All-American Game and scored 30 points, after averaging 26.8 ppg, 11.6 rebounds (rpg), and 10.1 assists per game (apg) for the season. Jordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia. In 1981, he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where Jordan majored in cultural geography. He chose this field of study because of its relationship to meteorology, as Jordan was interested in a career as a meteorologist. As a freshman under coach Dean Smith’s team-oriented system, Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year after averaging 13.4 points per game on 53.4% shooting—ranking 10th in scoring and sixth in field goal percentage in the conference. He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing. Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career. During his sophomore and junior seasons, Jordan consistently ranked among the ACC\'s elite, finishing either 1st or 2nd in both total points and points per game, while also placing in the top 10 in field goal percentage and free throw percentage. In his three seasons with the Tar Heels, Jordan averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting and added 5.0 rpg and 1.8 apg. Jordan was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons. After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina a year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986, when he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography. In 2002, Jordan was selected to the ACC 50th Anniversary men\'s basketball team and named the greatest athlete in ACC history. = Early NBA years (1984–1987) The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center. Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan. Citing Bowie\'s injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers\' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history. Jordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium on October 26, 1984, and scored 16 points. In 2021, a ticket stub from the game sold at auction for $264,000, setting a record for a collectible ticket stub. During his rookie 1984–85 season with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting. He helped the Bulls improve from 27–55 to 38–44 and qualify for the postseason for the first time since the 1980–81 season. Jordan quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas. Roy S. Johnson of The New York Times described Jordan as ""the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls"" in November, and he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the heading ""A Star Is Born"" in December. The fans voted in Jordan as an All-Star starter during his rookie season. Controversy arose before the 1985 NBA All-Star Game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving. This led to a so-called ""freeze-out"" on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him. The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year. The Bulls lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs. An often-cited moment was on August 26, 1985, when Jordan shook the arena during a Nike exhibition game in Trieste, Italy, by shattering the glass of the backboard with a dunk. The moment was filmed and is often referred to as an important milestone in Jordan\'s rise. The shoes Jordan wore during the game were auctioned in August 2020 for $615,000, a record for a pair of sneakers. Jordan\'s 1985–86 season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games. The Bulls made the playoffs despite Jordan\'s injury and a 30–52 record, at the time the fifth-worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history. Jordan recovered in time to participate in the postseason and performed well upon his return. On April 20 at the Boston Garden, in Game 2 of the First Round, a 135–131 double overtime loss to the eventual NBA champion Boston Celtics, Jordan scored a playoff career-high 63 points, breaking Elgin Baylor\'s single-game playoff scoring record. The Celtics team, though, swept the series in three games. Jordan completely recovered in time for the 1986–87 season, and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history; he became the only player other than Wilt Chamberlain to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league-high 37.1 ppg on 48.2% shooting. Jordan also demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season. Despite Jordan\'s success, Magic Johnson won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award. The Bulls reached 40 wins, and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year but were again swept by the Celtics. Pistons roadblock (1987–1990) Jordan led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting, and won his first league MVP Award. He was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year after averaging 1.6 blocks per game (bpg), a league-high 3.1 steals per game (spg), and leading the Bulls defense to the fewest points per game allowed in the league. The Bulls finished 50–32, and made it past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan\'s career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons, who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the ""Bad Boys"". In the 1988–89 season, Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8.0 rpg and 8.0 apg. During the season, Jordan expressed his frustration over the Bulls\' offense with head coach Doug Collins, who then put Jordan at point guard. In his time as a point guard, Jordan had 10 triple-doubles in 11 games, with averages of 33.6 ppg, 11.4 rpg, and 10.8 apg. The Bulls finished with a 47–35 record, and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way. The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit ""The Shot"" over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games, by utilizing their ""Jordan Rules"" method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of double and triple teaming him every time he touched the ball. The Bulls entered the 1989–90 season as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and under the guidance of new coach Phil Jackson. On March 28, 1990, Jordan scored a career-high 69 points in a 117–113 road win over the Cavaliers. He averaged a league-leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg, in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record. They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers; despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season. First three-peat (1991–1993) After the Bulls\' previous losses to the Pistons, Phil Jackson, along with assistant coach Tex Winter, focused on implementing the triangle offense to counteract the Pistons\' defense and other teams that heavily targeted Jordan. This system, however, required Jordan to adjust his playing style. In his book Eleven Rings, Jackson recalled, ""I was planning to ask Michael to reduce the number of shots he took so that other members of the team could get more involved in the offense. I knew this would be a challenge for him."" In The Last Dance, Jordan admitted he was initially reluctant to back the system. Nevertheless, he eventually embraced the change, which led to success for the team. In the 1990–91 season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season. The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in sixteen years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season. With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them; this time, the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep. The Bulls advanced to the Finals for the first time in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers. The Bulls won the series in five games, and compiled a 15–2 playoff record along the way. Perhaps the best-known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket. In his first Finals appearance, Jordan had 31.2 ppg on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 apg, 6.6 rpg, 2.8 spg, and 1.4 bpg. Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award and cried while holding the Finals trophy. Jordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the 1991–92 season, establishing a 67–15 record, topping their franchise record from the 1990–91 campaign. Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 ppg, 6.4 rpg, and 6.1 apg on 52% shooting. After winning a physical seven-game series over the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in six games, the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals. The media, hoping to recreate a Magic–Bird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between ""Air"" Jordan and Clyde ""The Glide"" during the pre-Finals hype. In a Game 1 victory, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals. After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying: ""I can\'t believe I\'m doing this."" The Bulls went on to defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 52.6% from the floor. In the 1992–93 season, despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, including a second-place finish in Defensive Player of the Year voting, Jordan\'s streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended, as he lost the award to his friend Charles Barkley, upsetting him. Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago\'s leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series, and became the first player in NBA history to win three consecutive Finals MVP awards. Jordan scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in four consecutive games. With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life. First retirement and stint in Minor League Baseball (1993–1995) On October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, saying that he lost his desire to play basketball. He later said that the murder of his father three months earlier helped shape his decision. James R.', 'Jordan co-owns an automotive group which bears his name. The company has a Nissan dealership in Durham, North Carolina, acquired in 1990, and formerly had a Lincoln–Mercury dealership from 1995 until its closure in June 2009. The company also owned a Nissan franchise in Glen Burnie, Maryland. The restaurant industry is another business interest of Jordan\'s. Restaurants he has owned include a steakhouse in New York City\'s Grand Central Terminal, among others; that restaurant closed in 2018. Jordan is the majority investor in a golf course, Grove XXIII in Hobe Sound, Florida. In September 2020, Jordan became an investor and advisor for DraftKings. = From 2001 to 2014, Jordan hosted an annual golf tournament, the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational, that raised money for various charities. In 2006, Jordan and his wife Juanita pledged $5 million to Chicago\'s Hales Franciscan High School. The Jordan Brand has made donations to Habitat for Humanity and a Louisiana branch of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. The Make-A-Wish Foundation named Jordan its Chief Wish Ambassador in 2008. In 2013, he granted his 200th wish for the organization. As of 2019, Jordan has raised more than $5 million for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. In 2023, he donated $10 million to the organization for his 60th birthday. In 2015, Jordan donated a settlement of undisclosed size from a lawsuit against supermarkets that had used his name without permission to 23 different Chicago charities. In 2017, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in Charlotte, North Carolina, by giving $7 million, the biggest donation he had made at the time. The following year, after Hurricane Florence damaged parts of North Carolina, including his former hometown of Wilmington, Jordan donated $2 million to relief efforts. He gave $1 million to aid the Bahamas\' recovery following Hurricane Dorian in 2019. Amidst the public uproar about the police shootings of two African-American men, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, and two deadly attacks against police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, Jordan made $1 million donations to two organizations, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Institute for Community-Police Relations. Jordan says the goal is to ""build trust and respect between communities and law enforcement."" He also said ""I can no longer stay silent. We need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment AND that police officers – who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all – are respected and supported."" On June 5, 2020, in the wake of the protests following the murder of George Floyd, Jordan and his brand announced in a joint statement that they would be donating $100 million over the next 10 years to organizations dedicated to ""ensuring racial equality, social justice and greater access to education"". In February 2021, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in New Hanover County, North Carolina, by giving $10 million. In 2024, he funded the opening of another Novant Health Clinic, this time in Wilmington. = Jordan played himself in the 1996 comedy film Space Jam. The film received mixed reviews, but it was a box office success, making $230 million worldwide, and earned more than $1 billion through merchandise sales. In 2000, Jordan was the subject of an IMAX documentary about his career with the Chicago Bulls, especially the 1998 NBA playoffs, titled Michael Jordan to the Max. Two decades later, the same period of Jordan\'s life was covered in much greater and more personal detail by the Emmy Award-winning The Last Dance, a 10-part TV documentary which debuted on ESPN in April and May 2020. The Last Dance relied heavily on about 500 hours of candid film of Jordan\'s and his teammates\' off-court activities which an NBA Entertainment crew had shot over the course of the 1997–98 NBA season for use in a documentary. The project was delayed for many years because Jordan had not yet given his permission for the footage to be used. Jordan was interviewed at three homes associated with the production and did not want cameras in his home or on his plane, as according to director Jason Hehir ""there are certain aspects of his life that he wants to keep private"". Jordan granted rapper Travis Scott permission to film a music video for his single ""Franchise"" at his home in Highland Park, Illinois. Jordan appeared in the 2022 miniseries The Captain, which follows the life and career of Derek Jeter. In May 2025, Jordan was announced as a special contributor for the NBA on NBC commentary team. = Jordan has authored several books focusing on his life, basketball career, and world view. Rare Air: Michael on Michael, with Mark Vancil and Walter Iooss (Harper San Francisco, 1993). I Can\'t Accept Not Trying: Michael Jordan on the Pursuit of Excellence, with Mark Vancil and Sandro Miller (Harper San Francisco, 1994).

He played 15 seasons in the NBA between 1984 and 2003, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. He was integral in popularizing basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a global cultural icon. Jordan played college basketball with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels\' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the best defensive players. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames ""Air Jordan"" and ""His Airness"". Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991 and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Citing physical and mental exhaustion from basketball and superstardom, Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball in the Chicago White Sox organization. He returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season. Jordan retired for the second time in January 1999, returning for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards. He was selected to play for the United States national team during his college and NBA careers, winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics—while also being undefeated. Jordan\'s individual accolades include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP awards, 10 All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, three NBA steals titles, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.1 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.4 points per game). He is one of only eight players to achieve the basketball Triple Crown. In 1999, Jordan was named the 20th century\'s greatest North American athlete by ESPN and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press\' list of athletes of the century. Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men\'s Olympic basketball team (""The Dream Team""). He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009, a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2010, and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a ""Dream Team"" member in 2017. Jordan was named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team in 1996 and to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. The trophy for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award is named in his honor. One of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan made many product endorsements. He fueled the success of Nike\'s Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular. Jordan starred as himself in the live-action/animation hybrid film Space Jam (1996) and was the central focus of the Emmy-winning documentary series The Last Dance (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Hornets (then named the Bobcats) in 2006 and bought a controlling interest in 2010, before selling his majority stake in 2023. Jordan is also a co-owner of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. In 2014, he became the first billionaire player in NBA history. That same year, President Barack Obama awarded Jordan the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As of 2025, his net worth is estimated at $3.5 billion by Forbes, making him one of the richest celebrities. Michael Jeffrey Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in Brooklyn, New York City, on February 17, 1963, to bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan Sr.', 'declined after his last title. As late as 2022, NBA Finals television ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season. In August 2009, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame opened a Michael Jordan exhibit. After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present him. As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels when growing up in North Carolina but greatly admired Thompson, who played for the rival NC State Wolfpack. In September, Jordan was inducted into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kukoč. Dean Smith and Doug Collins, two of Jordan\'s former coaches, were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his speech when Jordan began to cry was captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later go viral on social media as the ""Crying Jordan"" Internet meme. In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In October 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. In September 2022, Jordan\'s jersey in which he played the opening game of the 1998 NBA Finals was sold for $10.1 million, making it the most expensive game-worn sports memorabilia in history. In December 2022, the NBA unveiled a new MVP trophy, named in Jordan\'s honor, to be awarded beginning with the 2022–23 season, which replaced the original trophy, named in honor of former NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff. = = NBA Six-time NBA champion – 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998 Six-time NBA Finals MVP – 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998 Five-time NBA MVP – 1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998 NBA Defensive Player of the Year – 1987–88 NBA Rookie of the Year – 1984–85 10-time NBA scoring leader – 1987–1993, 1996–1998 Three-time NBA steals leader – 1988, 1990, 1993 14-time NBA All-Star – 1985–1993, 1996–1998, 2002, 2003 Three-time NBA All-Star Game MVP – 1988, 1996, 1998 10-time All-NBA First Team – 1987–1993, 1996–1998 One-time All-NBA Second Team – 1985 Nine-time NBA All-Defensive First Team – 1988–1993, 1996–1998 NBA All-Rookie First Team – 1985 Two-time NBA Slam Dunk Contest champion – 1987, 1988 Two-time IBM Award winner – 1985, 1989 Named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996 Selected on the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021 No. 23 retired by the Chicago Bulls No. 23 retired by the Miami Heat Chicago Bulls Ring of Honor NBA MVP trophy renamed in Jordan\'s honor (""Michael Jordan Trophy"") in 2022 USA Basketball Two-time Olympic gold medal winner – 1984, 1992 Tournament of the Americas gold medal winner – 1992 Pan American Games gold medal winner – 1983 Pan American Games Most Outstanding Player – 1983 Three-time USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year – 1983, 1984, 1992 NCAA NCAA national championship – 1981–82 ACC Rookie of the Year – 1981–82 Two-time Consensus NCAA All-American First Team – 1982–83, 1983–84 ACC Men\'s Basketball Player of the Year – 1983–84 ACC Athlete of the Year – 1984 Two-time Sporting News National Player of the Year (1983, 1984) AP College Player of the Year – 1983–84 USBWA College Player of the Year – 1983–84 Naismith College Player of the Year – 1983–84 Adolph Rupp Trophy – 1983–84 John R.

Jordan\'s previous tenure had produced mixed results and may have also influenced the trade of Richard ""Rip"" Hamilton for Jerry Stackhouse, although Jordan was not technically Director of Basketball Operations in 2002. On May 7, 2003, Wizards owner Abe Pollin fired Jordan from the role. Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he had known he would be fired upon retiring, he never would have come back to play for the Wizards. Over the next few years, Jordan played golf in celebrity charity tournaments and spent time with his family in Chicago. He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles. Since 2004, Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) until the end of the 2013 season. = On June 15, 2006, Jordan bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats (known as the Hornets since 2013), becoming the team\'s second-largest shareholder behind majority owner Robert L. Johnson. As part of the deal, Jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title Managing Member of Basketball Operations. Despite his previous success as an endorser, Jordan made an effort not to be included in Charlotte\'s marketing campaigns. A decade earlier, he had made a bid to become part-owner of Charlotte\'s original NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, but talks collapsed when owner George Shinn refused to give Jordan complete control of basketball operations. In February 2010, it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats. As February wore on, it became apparent that Jordan and former Houston Rockets president George Postolos were the leading contenders for ownership of the team. On February 27, the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his group, MJ Basketball Holdings, to buy the team from Johnson pending NBA approval. On March 17, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan\'s purchase, making him the first former player to become the majority owner of an NBA team, and the league\'s only African-American majority owner. During the 2011 NBA lockout, The New York Times wrote that Jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners who wanted to cap the players\' share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47. Journalists observed that, during the labor dispute in 1998, Jordan told Washington Wizards then-owner Abe Pollin: ""If you can\'t make a profit, you should sell your team."" Jason Whitlock of FoxSports.com called Jordan ""a hypocrite sellout who can easily betray the very people who made him a billionaire global icon"" for wanting ""current players to pay for his incompetence"". He cited Jordan\'s executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison. During the 2011–12 NBA season that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout, the Bobcats posted a 7–59 record. The team closed out the season with a 23-game losing streak; their .106 winning percentage was the worst in NBA history. Before the next season, Jordan said: ""I\'m not real happy about the record book scenario last year. It\'s very, very frustrating."" During the 2019 NBA offseason, Jordan sold a minority piece of the Hornets to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim, retaining the majority for himself, as well as the role of chairman. In 2023, Jordan finalized the sale of his majority stake to Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall, ending his 13-year tenure as majority owner, although he kept a minority stake. The sale was officially completed in August 2023 for approximately $3 billion, more than 10 times the $275 million Jordan had paid for the team. = On September 21, 2020, Jordan and NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin announced they would be fielding a NASCAR Cup Series team with Bubba Wallace driving, beginning competition in the 2021 season. On October 22, the team\'s name was confirmed to be 23XI Racing (pronounced twenty-three eleven) and the team\'s entry would bear No. 23. After the team\'s inaugural season, it added a second car with No. 45, driven by Kurt Busch in 2022 and Tyler Reddick in 2023. Ty Gibbs, John Hunter Nemechek, and Daniel Hemric also drove for 23XI as substitute drivers during the 2022 season. The team fielded a third car, No. 67, driven by Travis Pastrana in the 2023 Daytona 500. Reddick won the 2024 NASCAR Cup Series regular season championship, the first for the team. 23XI Racing acquired a third charter from the defunct Stewart-Haas Racing, the No.', 'Green and Demery were sentenced to life imprisonment. However, in The Last Dance, Jordan stated that he retired due to physical and mental exhaustion from basketball and superstardom. Jordan was close to his father; as a child, Jordan imitated the way his father stuck out his tongue while absorbed in work. Jordan later adopted it as his own signature, often displaying it as he drove to the basket. In 1996, Jordan founded a Chicago-area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father. In his 1998 autobiography For the Love of the Game, Jordan wrote that he was preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992. The added exhaustion due to the ""Dream Team"" run in the 1992 Summer Olympics solidified Jordan\'s feelings about the game and his celebrity status. Jordan\'s announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world. Jordan further surprised the sports world by signing a Minor League Baseball (MiLB) contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994. He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and was assigned to the team\'s minor league system on March 31. Jordan said that this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball (MLB) player. The White Sox were owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued to honor Jordan\'s basketball contract during the years he played baseball. In 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a Double-A minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, batting .202 with three home runs, 51 runs batted in, 30 stolen bases, 114 strikeouts, 51 bases on balls, and 11 errors. His strikeout total led the team and his games played tied for the team lead. His 30 stolen bases were second on the team only to Doug Brady. Jordan also appeared for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the 1994 Arizona Fall League, batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball. On November 1, 1994, his No. 23 was retired by the Bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as The Spirit outside the new United Center. Return to the NBA (1995) The Bulls went 55–27 in 1993–94 without Jordan in the lineup and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs. In March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball because he feared he might become a replacement player during the Major League Baseball strike. During the 1994–95 season, Jordan returned to the Bulls midway through the season. On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his comeback to the NBA in a two-word press release: ""I\'m back."" The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points. The game had the highest Nielsen rating of any regular season NBA game since 1975. Although he could have worn his original number even though the Bulls retired it, Jordan wore No. 45, his baseball number. Despite his 18-month hiatus from the NBA, Jordan played well, making a game-winning jump shot against Atlanta in his fourth game back. He scored 55 points in his next game, against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995. Boosted by Jordan\'s comeback, the Bulls went 13–4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Orlando Magic. At the end of Game 1, Orlando\'s Nick Anderson stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic; he later commented that Jordan ""didn\'t look like the old Michael Jordan"", and said, ""No. 45 doesn\'t explode like No.', 'On April 23, 2019, Middleton and his girlfriend welcomed their first daughter.', 'He returned to action on December 31 against the Minnesota Timberwolves after a 22-game absence. In his second game back on January 2, he scored 25 points in a 126–121 loss to the Brooklyn Nets. On March 10, he had 15 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 128–116 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. On March 12, he had his second consecutive triple-double with 14 points, a career-high 15 rebounds and 11 assists in a 130–113 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks, becoming the first New Orleans player to have a triple-double in consecutive games since Chris Paul in 2008. On March 15, he had his third consecutive triple-double with 14 points, 12 rebounds and a career-high 16 assists in a 122–110 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. The next day, he recorded his fourth straight triple-double with 16 points, 16 assists and 13 rebounds in a 138–136 overtime loss to the Phoenix Suns, joining James Harden, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and Russell Westbrook as the only players since the 1983–84 season to record triple-doubles in as many as four straight games, and eighth in NBA history. Payton recorded his fifth consecutive triple-double two days later with 19 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds in a 129–125 overtime win over the Dallas Mavericks. He also tied Chris Paul for most triple-doubles in a season in franchise history with six, and became only the fifth player to record five consecutive triple-doubles, joining Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, Oscar Robertson, and Russell Westbrook. = On July 9, 2019, Payton signed a reported two-year deal with the New York Knicks.', '23 used to"". Jordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan decided that he would immediately resume wearing his former No. 23. The Bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA. Jordan was fined an additional $5,000 for opting to wear white sneakers when the rest of the Bulls wore black. He averaged 31 ppg in the playoffs, but Orlando won the series in six games. Second three-peat (1996–1998) Jordan was motivated by the playoff defeat, and he trained aggressively for the 1995–96 season. The Bulls were strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, and the team dominated the league, starting the season at 41–3. The Bulls finished with the best regular season record in NBA history, 72–10, a mark broken two decades later by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors. Jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg, and he won the league\'s regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards. In the playoffs, the Bulls lost only three games in four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, and Orlando Magic 4–0), as they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship. The series was one of the tougher ones for Jordan as he had a 41.5% field goal percentage and his scoring average dropped nearly nine points from his average during the rest of the playoffs. Nevertheless, Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time; he achieved only the second sweep of the MVP awards in the All-Star Game, regular season, and NBA Finals after Willis Reed in the 1969–70 season. Upon winning the championship, his first since his father\'s murder, Jordan reacted emotionally, clutching the game ball and crying on the locker room floor. In the 1996–97 season, the Bulls stood at a 69–11 record but ended the season by losing their final two games to finish the year 69–13, missing out on a second consecutive 70-win season. The Bulls again advanced to the Finals, where they faced the Utah Jazz. That team included Karl Malone, who had beaten Jordan for the NBA MVP award in a tight race (986–957). The series against the Jazz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of Jordan\'s career. He won Game 1 for the Bulls with a buzzer-beating jump shot. In Game 5, with the series tied 2–2, Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus. In what is known as ""The Flu Game"", Jordan scored 38 points, including the game-winning three-pointer with 25 seconds remaining. The Bulls won 90–88 and went on to win the series in six games. For the fifth time in as many Finals appearances, Jordan received the Finals MVP award. During the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, he posted the first triple-double in All-Star Game history in a victorious effort, but the MVP award went to Glen Rice. The Bulls compiled a 62–20 record in the 1997–98 season. Jordan led the league with 28.7 ppg, securing his fifth regular season MVP award, plus honors for All-NBA First Team, First Defensive Team, and the All-Star Game MVP. The Bulls won the Eastern Conference Championship for a third straight season, including surviving a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals; it was the first time Jordan had played in a Game 7 since the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the New York Knicks. After winning, they moved on for a rematch with the Jazz in the Finals. The Bulls returned to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered to be one of the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history. With 41.9 seconds remaining and the Bulls trailing 86–83, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and sank a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting Utah\'s lead to 86–85. The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and stole the ball out of his hands. Jordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul. With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan made the climactic shot of his Bulls career, a top-key jumper over a stumbling Russell to give Chicago an 87–86 lead. Afterwards, the Jazz\' John Stockton narrowly missed a game-winning three-pointer, and the buzzer sounded as Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship, achieving a second three-peat in the decade. Once again, Jordan was voted Finals MVP for a record sixth time, having led all scorers by averaging 33.5 ppg, including 45 in the deciding Game 6. The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series, and Game 6 holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history. Second retirement (1999–2001) With Phil Jackson\'s contract expiring, the pending departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999. On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards. Jordan\'s responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards\' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters; opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed. He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (like forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland) but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high school student Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons. Despite his January 1999 claim that he was ""99.9% certain"" he would never play another NBA game, Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback in the summer of 2001, this time with his new team. Inspired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter, Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding several invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago. Jordan hired his old Chicago Bulls head coach, Doug Collins, as Washington\'s coach for the upcoming season, a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another Jordan return. = On September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks. In an injury-plagued 2001–02 season, Jordan led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.4 spg), and was an MVP candidate, as he led the Wizards to a winning record and playoff contention; Jordan would eventually finish 13th in the MVP ballot. After he suffered torn cartilage in his right knee, and subsequent knee soreness, the Wizards missed the playoffs, and Jordan\'s season ended after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994–95 season. Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 ppg, 5.4 apg, and 6.0 rpg, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts. His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game. The Wizards finished the season with a 37–45 record, an 18-game improvement. Playing in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history, a record since broken by Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them as he came off the bench in 15. Jordan averaged 20.0 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 spg per game. He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free-throw line. Although Jordan turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times. On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game. During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan\'s home games at the MCI Center were sold out and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road. Jordan\'s final two seasons did not result in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and he was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him. At several points, Jordan openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of Kwame Brown, the number-one draft pick in the 2001 NBA draft. Final retirement (2003) With the recognition that 2002–03 would be Jordan\'s final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA. In his final game at the United Center in Chicago, which was his old home court, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation. The Miami Heat retired the No. 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team. At the 2003 All-Star Game, Jordan was offered a starting spot from Tracy McGrady and Allen Iverson but refused both; he accepted the spot of Vince Carter. Jordan played in his final NBA game on April 16, 2003, in Philadelphia. After scoring 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds left in the third quarter and his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers 75–56. Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting ""We want Mike!"" After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers\' Eric Snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. He received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans. Jordan made his debut as a college player for the U.S. national basketball team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela. He led the team in scoring with 17.3 ppg as the U.S., coached by Jack Hartman, won the gold medal. The following year, Jordan won another gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The 1984 U.S. team was coached by Bob Knight and featured young players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale. Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament. In 1992, Jordan, now an NBA player, was a member of the star-studded squad that was dubbed the ""Dream Team"", which included Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. The team won two gold medals: the first in the 1992 Tournament of the Americas, and the second in the 1992 Summer Olympics. Jordan was the only player to start all eight games in the Olympics. He averaged 14.9 ppg on 45% shooting from the field and 68% from the free-throw line, and was second on the team in scoring. He was undefeated in the four tournaments he played for the United States national team, and Jordan won all 30 games he took part in. Jordan was a shooting guard who could also play as a small forward, the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards. Jordan was known throughout his career as a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests. His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash talk and well-known work ethic. Jordan often used perceived slights to fuel his performances. Sportswriter Wright Thompson described him as ""a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediately sensing and attacking someone\'s weakest spot"". As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not ""tough enough"" to compete with him in practice. To improve his defense, Jordan spent hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvization. Jordan\'s fierce competitiveness greatly impacted his teammates, sometimes motivating them but also leading to tension and alienation. Noted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986–87 to 2001–02, when he injured his right knee. Of the 15 seasons Jordan was in the NBA, he played all 82 regular season games nine times. Jordan has frequently cited David Thompson, Walter Davis, and Jerry West as influences. Confirmed at the start of his career, and possibly later on, Jordan had a special ""Love of the Game Clause"" written into his contract, which was unusual at the time, and allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere. Jordan had a versatile offensive game and was capable of aggressively driving to the basket as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate. His 8,772 free throw attempts are the 11th-highest total in NBA history. Early in Jordan\'s career, he weighed in at around 200 pounds (91 kg) and was more athletic in terms of play style. As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot, using his leaping ability to avoid block attempts. According to Hubie Brown, this move alone made Jordan nearly unstoppable. Around this time, he bulked up to 215 pounds (98 kg) in order to adapt to the increased physicality of NBA defenses during the 1990s, sacrificing some athleticism for added strength in the post. Despite media criticism by some as a selfish player early in his career, Jordan was willing to defer to this teammates, with a career average of 5.3 apg and a season-high of 8.0 apg. For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder, finishing with 6.2 rpg. Defensively, he averaged 2.3 spg and 0.8 bpg. The three-point field goal was not Jordan\'s strength, especially in his early years. Later on in his career, Jordan improved his three-point shooting, and finished his career with a three-point field goal percentage of 32%. His best years shooting from three occurred in the 1989–90 and 1992–93 seasons, where he shot 37% and 35% from three, respectively (Jordan did shoot higher percentages from 1994 to 1997, but in those years, the three-point line was temporarily moved inwards). Overall, Jordan\'s effective field goal percentage was 51%, and he had six seasons with at least 50% shooting, five of which were consecutive (1988–1992). Jordan also shot 51% and 50% from the field, and 30% and 33% from three-point range, throughout his first and second retirements, respectively, finishing his Bulls career with 31.5 points per game on 50.5 FG% shooting and his overall career with 49.7 FG% shooting. In 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA Defensive Player of the Year and Most Valuable Player awards. No NBA player had previously won both awards in their career. He also set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard, and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. Despite his defensive prowess, the 1988 season has come under scrutiny due to the large discrepancy between Jordan\'s steals\' numbers at home versus on the road. Such stat inflation was common, and a 2024 study by Tom Haberstroh found that there were games where Jordan was often credited with steals that could not have happened. For example, in one game, he was credited with more steals than the opposing team had live-ball turnovers. Jordan ranks fourth in NBA history in total steals with 2,514, trailing John Stockton, Jason Kidd and Chris Paul. Jerry West often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan\'s defensive contributions than his offensive ones. Doc Rivers declared Jordan ""the best superstar defender in the history of the game"". Jordan was known to have strong eyesight. Broadcaster Al Michaels said that Jordan was able to read baseball box scores on a 27-inch (69 cm) television clearly from about 50 feet (15 m) away. During the 2001 NBA Finals, Phil Jackson compared Jordan\'s dominance to Shaquille O\'Neal, stating: ""Michael would get fouled on every play and still have to play through it and just clear himself for shots instead and would rise to that occasion."" Jordan\'s talent was clear from his first NBA season; by November 1984, he was being compared to Julius Erving. Larry Bird said that rookie Jordan was the best player he ever saw, and that Jordan was ""one of a kind"", and comparable to Wayne Gretzky as an athlete. In his first game in Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a near minute-long standing ovation. After Jordan established the single game playoff record of 63 points against the Boston Celtics on April 20, 1986, Bird described him as ""God disguised as Michael Jordan"". Jordan led the NBA in scoring in 10 seasons (NBA record) and tied Wilt Chamberlain\'s record of seven consecutive scoring titles. Jordan was a fixture of the NBA All-Defensive First Team, making the roster nine times (NBA record shared with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant). He also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 ppg, respectively. By 1998, the season of his Finals-winning shot against the Jazz, he was well known throughout the league as a clutch performer. In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls\' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time. Jordan\'s total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest among NBA career playoff scoring leaders. He scored 32,292 points in the regular season, placing him fifth on the NBA all-time scoring list behind LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, and Bryant. With five regular season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill Russell—only Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three NBA All-Star Game MVPs, Jordan is among the most decorated players in NBA history. He finished among the top three in regular season MVP voting 10 times. Jordan was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996, and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. He is one of only eight players in history to achieve the basketball Triple Crown—winning an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men\'s basketball teams). Since 1976, the year of the ABA–NBA merger, Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team. In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times. Many of Jordan\'s contemporaries have said that he is the greatest basketball player of all time. In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century. Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press\' December 1999 list of 20th century athletes. The Associated Press also voted Jordan the greatest basketball player of the 20th century. He has also appeared on the front cover of Sports Illustrated a record 50 times. In the September 1996 issue of Sport, which was the publication\'s 50th-anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years. Jordan\'s athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players. Several NBA players, including James and Dwyane Wade, have stated that they considered Jordan as their role model while they were growing up. Commentators have also dubbed a number of next-generation players ""the next Michael Jordan"" upon their entry to the NBA, including Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Bryant, Vince Carter, James, and Wade. Jordan\'s jersey number, 23, also became iconic; numerous subsequent NBA players have worn it to pay tribute to him, including James, Metta Sandiford-Artest, and Anthony Davis. Although Jordan was a well-rounded player, his ""Air Jordan"" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players, a fact Jordan himself has lamented, saying: ""I think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of Michael Jordan. Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking. That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized."" During his heyday, Jordan did much to increase the status of the game; television ratings increased only during his time in the league.

Crotty had been a two-time All-American at Williams College, having served as point guard for the 2003 NCAA Division III Tournament champions (and 2004 Tournament runners up). Following his senior season, Robinson measured 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) and 175 pounds (79.4 kg). By the end of the summer, he had grown to 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m) and 195 pounds (88.5 kg). During the last weekend of September 2012 while on a campus visit, Division III Williams made Robinson an offer that he accepted immediately. At the time, Williams was ranked the number one liberal arts college in the country according to U.S. News & World Report, and the school was a Division III basketball powerhouse.', '7 national ranking from USA Today. On September 10, 2001, Rainier Beach retired Robinson\'s No. 2 jersey. Robinson was originally enrolled at Washington on a football scholarship, but decided to concentrate on basketball beginning with his sophomore year. He played all 13 football games in 2002 and started the final six games as a cornerback on the Husky football squad, including the Sun Bowl. He intercepted two passes and made 34 tackles. In his freshman basketball season at Washington in 2002–03, Robinson was named to the CollegeInsider.com\'s 20-player national All-Freshmen Team, as well as earning All-Pac-10 Freshman Team honors. He led the team in scoring average with 13.0 points per game, a figure that ranked 17th among Pac-10 players; also his 300 points tied for fourth among all-time UW freshmen. In his sophomore season, Robinson was named to the All-Pac-10 first team after he led the team and ranked 13th among Pac-10 scorers with 13.2 points per game. In his junior season, Robinson was named to the NABC All-NCAA District 14 first team, NABC All-America third team, Pac-10 All-Tournament team and All-Pac-10 first team after leading Washington to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament In April 2005, Robinson declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his final year of college eligibility. = Robinson was selected with the 21st overall pick by the Phoenix Suns in the 2005 NBA draft. He was later traded to the New York Knicks on draft night along with Quentin Richardson in exchange for Kurt Thomas and the draft rights to Dijon Thompson. Robinson played in 72 games his rookie year, starting 26 of them, while averaging 9.3 points and 2.0 assists per game. He had a major breakout performance against the Philadelphia 76ers at Madison Square Garden where he scored 17 points and grabbed 6 rebounds. Of his 17 points, three came on a game-winning three-pointer at the overtime buzzer. During the All-Star weekend, Robinson won the 2006 Sprite Rising Stars Slam Dunk Contest, edging Andre Iguodala 141–140 in overtime, although he took 14 attempts to make his final dunk. In his most memorable dunk of the night, he jumped over 1986 champion Spud Webb, and received a perfect 50-point score for the dunk. During the 2005–06 season, Robinson was reportedly involved in physical altercations between teammates Jerome James and Malik Rose in separate incidents. He was at one point considered by Knicks\' coach Larry Brown to be demoted to the NBA Development League. He was instead placed on the Inactive List for 10 games between February 24 and March 11. On November 11, 2006, Robinson blocked the 7\'6"" Yao Ming during the Knicks\' 97–90 loss to the Houston Rockets. It became one of his career highlights owing to the unlikeliness of the event and Robinson\'s own athletic abilities. On December 16, 2006, Robinson was one of the primary participants in the brawl between the Denver Nuggets and the Knicks. His fight with Nuggets guard J.', ""The narrative is set mainly in Europe, especially in England and Italy. Generally regarded as the masterpiece of his early phase, The Portrait of a Lady is described as a psychological novel, exploring the minds of his characters, and almost a work of social science, exploring the differences between Europeans and Americans, the old and the new worlds. The second period of James's career, which extends from the publication of The Portrait of a Lady through the end of the 19th century, features less popular novels, including The Princess Casamassima, published serially in The Atlantic Monthly in 1885–1886, and The Bostonians, published serially in The Century during the same period. This period also featured James's celebrated Gothic novella, The Turn of the Screw (1898). The third period of James's career reached its most significant achievement in three novels published just around the start of the 20th century: The Wings of the Dove (1902), The Ambassadors (1903), and The Golden Bowl (1904). Critic F."", 'He made the all-district, all-Metro, and all-State teams for his efforts. Robinson then joined Dallas-based Nike Pro Skills on the AAU circuit for the summer, winning individual honors in the Nike EYBL and leading Pro Skills to the season-ending Peach Jam. His recruiting ranking shot up, and he earned his fifth star. Against the top players in the country, Robinson averaged 15.5 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 4.1 blocks per game, being named to the All-EYBL second team. As a senior at Chalmette, Robinson averaged 25.7 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 6 blocked shots per outing, while earning Naismith Trophy All-America honorable mention and MaxPreps All-America honorable mention status as well as USA Today All-USA Louisiana first team honors and being named All-District, All-Metro, All-State, and the All-Metro Player of the Year from the New Orleans Advocate, as well as the St. Bernard Post Male Athlete of the Year for the parish. He led Chalmette to their first district championship in their own regular season tournament in 20 years, first district title in 21 years in the toughest basketball district in the state, and to the state semifinals for the first time in 32 years. In the Owls\' four-game state playoff run, Robinson averaged 34.5 points, 13.5 rebounds, and 7.8 blocks. Robinson became the first Chalmette basketball player to be named a McDonald\'s All-American, and also played in the Jordan Brand Classic and the LHSBCA All-Star game. Playing in the 2017 McDonald\'s All-American Boys Game, Robinson tallied 14 points, three rebounds and two blocked shots. He participated in the 2017 Jordan Brand Classic, scoring 15 points in 17 minutes of play, while pulling down three rebounds. Robinson originally committed to play college basketball at Texas A&M, but then de-committed to follow coach Rick Stansbury to Western Kentucky. Stansbury had recruited Robinson as the Aggies\' assistant coach. Basketball writer Jason Frakes wrote in February 2017, Robinson ""may go down as the biggest recruiting coup in WKU basketball history."" In July 2017, Robinson had enrolled at Western Kentucky University for the summer semester, and practiced with the team for about two weeks before a planned team trip to Costa Rica. Sources then indicated that he had left campus, and his room was cleaned out.', 'Robinson earned all-area and all-district honors but generated little interest among college basketball coaches. Robinson graduated from Osbourn Park in 1983. He achieved a score of 1320 on the SAT and subsequently attended the United States Naval Academy, where he would major in mathematics and play on the basketball team. At the time the Naval Academy had a height restriction of 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) for all midshipmen, but in the autumn when the new academic year began, Robinson had grown to 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m). Assuming that he was unlikely to grow much more, the academy\'s superintendent granted him a waiver, but Robinson continued growing, and by the start of his second year at the academy he had nearly reached his adult height of 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m), which later prevented him from serving on any U.S. Navy ships. In 2011, Robinson earned a Master of Arts in Administration (with concentration in organizational development) from the University of the Incarnate Word to better ""understand how businesses work and how to build them."" Robinson is widely considered to be the best basketball player in Naval Academy history. He chose the jersey number 50 after his idol Ralph Sampson. He began college with no expectations of playing in the NBA, but in Robinson\'s final two years he was a consensus All-American and won college basketball\'s two most prestigious player awards, the Naismith and Wooden Awards, as a Naval Academy first classman (senior). In 1986, Robinson led Navy, a number seven seed, within a game of the Final Four before falling to Duke in the East Regional Final. Robinson played his first three years for the Midshipmen under Paul Evans (who left Navy to coach at Pitt) and his senior season under former University of Georgia interim head coach Pete Herrmann. Upon graduation, he became eligible for the 1987 NBA draft and was selected by the San Antonio Spurs with the first overall pick; however, the Spurs had to wait two years because he had to fulfill his active-duty obligation with the Navy. Robinson considered leaving the academy after his second year, before incurring an obligation to serve on active duty. He decided to stay after discussing with the superintendent the likelihood that his height would prevent him from serving at sea as an unrestricted line officer, which would be detrimental to his naval career and might make it impossible for him to receive a commission at all. As a compromise, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman allowed Robinson to train for and receive a commission as a staff officer in the Civil Engineer Corps. As a result, Robinson was commissioned in the Naval Reserve and was required to serve only an initial active-duty obligation of two years. After graduating from the Naval Academy, Robinson became a civil engineering officer at the Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia. He was regularly featured in recruiting materials for the service. Despite the nickname ""Admiral"", the highest rank Robinson earned during his military service was lieutenant (junior grade). = Rookie of the Year, DPOY award and scoring title (1989–1994) Since he had not signed a contract, NBA regulations stated that Robinson could have reentered the draft after his naval service. Although there was speculation that he might choose not to sign with the Spurs, Robinson agreed to move to San Antonio for the 1989–90 season, but the Spurs agreed to pay him as much as the average of the salaries of the two highest-paid players in the league each year, or release him to free agency. The Spurs had spent the second half of the 1980s as an also-ran, bottoming out in 1988–89 season with a 21–61 record, the worst in franchise history at the time. While it was widely thought that the Spurs would become respectable again once Robinson arrived, no one expected what happened in his rookie season. Robinson led the Spurs to the greatest single-season turnaround in NBA history at the time (a record the Spurs themselves broke in 1997–98 season, after drafting Tim Duncan, which was then broken by the Boston Celtics in the 2007–08 NBA season). The Spurs leaped to a record of 56–26 for a remarkable 35 game improvement. They advanced to the second round of the Western Conference playoffs where they lost in seven games to the eventual conference champion Portland Trail Blazers. Following the 1989–90 season, he was unanimously named the NBA Rookie of the Year, and subsequently Sega produced a game featuring him entitled David Robinson\'s Supreme Court. The Spurs made the playoffs seven more seasons in a row. In the 1991–92 season Robinson led the league in blocks and was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Robinson also made the 1992 US Olympic Dream Team that won the gold medal in Barcelona. During the 1993–94 season, he became locked in a duel for the NBA scoring title with Shaquille O\'Neal, scoring 71 points (breaking George Gervin\'s single-game franchise record of 63) against the Los Angeles Clippers to win it. In that season, Robinson averaged a career-high 29.8 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, career-high 4.8 assists per game and 3.3 blocks per game. MVP title, playoff upsets and injury (1994–1998) Robinson went on to win the MVP trophy in 1995, and in 1996 he was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. Still, from 1991 to 1996, Robinson was thwarted in his quest to claim the one prize that had eluded him: an NBA title. During that span the Spurs were eliminated from the playoffs by the Warriors, Suns (twice), Jazz (twice), and Rockets. The loss against the Rockets was particularly painful for Robinson because it occurred in the Western Conference Finals with Robinson playing head-to-head against his chief rival, Hakeem Olajuwon. By his own admission, Robinson was outplayed by Olajuwon in the series, their only meetings in post-season play. In a LIFE magazine story, he seemed perplexed. “Solve Hakeem?” said Robinson. “You don’t solve Hakeem.” Early in the 1996–97 season, Robinson\'s dreams of becoming a champion seemed to vanish when he hurt his back in the preseason. He finally returned in December, but six games later broke his foot in a home game against the Miami Heat, and ended up missing the rest of the regular season. As a result of the injury to Robinson and other key players (most notably Sean Elliott, who missed more than half the season), the Spurs finished the season with a dismal 20–62 record. However, his injury proved to be a blessing in disguise. Despite having only the third-worst record in the league, the Spurs won the NBA Draft Lottery—and with it, the first pick in the next year\'s NBA draft. They used that pick to select Tim Duncan out of Wake Forest University, who was, after a few years, the final key to Robinson\'s quest for an NBA title. Championship season (1998–1999) The later years of Robinson\'s career were plagued by back ailments. Before the start of the 1998–99 season, the NBA owners and NBA commissioner David Stern locked out the NBA Players\' Association to force negotiations on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement. This lockout lasted for 202 days, well into the regular NBA season, before an agreement was finally reached. After playing a truncated 50-game season, the Spurs finished with an NBA-best record of 37–13, giving them the home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. The Spurs blitzed through the first three rounds of the NBA playoffs, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves, Los Angeles Lakers, and Portland Trail Blazers by a combined record of 11–1 to reach the NBA Finals for the first time ever. In the Finals, the combination of Robinson in the post and second-year power forward Tim Duncan proved overpowering, and the Spurs beat the New York Knicks in five games to become the first former American Basketball Association team to win an NBA title. Duncan was named Finals MVP. Robinson and Duncan were nicknamed ""The Twin Towers"". Twilight years and second championship (1999–2003) During the 1999–00 season, Robinson averaged 17.8 points per game, 10.0 rebounds per game and 2.3 blocks per game in 80 games. The Spurs made it to the playoffs as the fourth seed, but were defeated by the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the playoffs despite Robinson\'s 23.5 points, 13.8 rebounds, and 3 blocks per game. Robinson announced he would retire from basketball following the 2002–03 season. On June 15, 2003, in the finale of Robinson\'s career, the Spurs won another NBA title with an 88–77 victory over the New Jersey Nets in Game 6 of the 2003 NBA Finals. During this game, Robinson scored 13 points, as well as getting 17 rebounds. He and the year\'s regular season and NBA Finals MVP Tim Duncan shared Sports Illustrated magazine\'s 2003 Sportsmen of the Year award. Robinson possessed tremendous mobility in the post, speed, and ball-handling, especially for a center. With good hands on both offense and defense, Robinson was nearly unstoppable on both sides of the floor, throwing down dunks and blocking shots. He was also noted for his strong midrange jumpshot. Robinson averaged 21.1 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, 3 blocks per game, and 2.5 assists per game over 987 games in his NBA career. He is also one of only a very small group of players to have scored over 20,000 career points in the NBA, as well as being one of only four players to have recorded a quadruple-double (with 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 blocks against the Detroit Pistons on February 17, 1994). He is also one of only ten players to record 70 or more points in a single game. Robinson scored 71 points against the Los Angeles Clippers on April 24, 1994. Only Elgin Baylor (71 points), Wilt Chamberlain (70, 72, 73 twice, 78, 100 points), David Thompson (73 points), Devin Booker (70 points), Donovan Mitchell (71 points), Damian Lillard (71 points), Kobe Bryant (81 points), Joel Embiid (70 points), and Luka Dončić (73 points) have scored 70 or more points in a single game. Robinson is also noteworthy for his harmonious relationship with Tim Duncan.', ""He won the James Norris Memorial Trophy twice (1976–77 and 1979–80) as the league's most outstanding defenceman and won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the 1978 playoffs. He was named to the league's first and second all-star teams three times each. His peak years were 1976–77 to 1980–81, although he had a strong comeback season at age 34 in 1985–86 when he was again named to the second all-star team and scored 82 points, just three shy of his career high of 85 (1976–77). Robinson was a dominant player whose talent and leadership helped lead the Canadiens to six Stanley Cups. Robinson was a member of Team Canada in the 1976, 1981 and 1984 Canada Cup tournaments and was an international All-Star team selection in the 1981 IIHF World Championships. During his career, he played in ten of the league's All-Star games and ended his 20-year career having scored 208 goals, 750 assists and 958 regular-season points as well as 144 points in 227 playoff games, a remarkable achievement for a defenceman. He holds an impressive career plus-minus rating of +730, the NHL career record, including an overwhelming +120 in 1976–77 (second only to Bobby Orr's record +124 in 1970–71, and with Orr and Wayne Gretzky (+100 1984–85), is one of only three players to have a plus-minus rating of +100 or greater for a season). He won the Stanley Cup six times with the Canadiens, in 1973, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1986. Together with Nicklas Lidstrom, Robinson holds the NHL record for most consecutive playoff seasons with 20, 17 of them with the Canadiens. Robinson has been honoured for his playing career. In 1995, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1998, he was ranked number 24 on The Hockey News' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. In 2000, he was inducted into the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame. On November 19, 2007, the Canadiens retired Robinson's No. 19 jersey before a loss against the Ottawa Senators. Larry Robinson's name appears on the Stanley Cup ten times, six as a player, three as a coach or assistant coach and once as a scout. Following his retirement, Robinson was hired as an assistant coach with the New Jersey Devils in 1993. After winning the Stanley Cup in 1995 with the Devils, he was hired as head coach of the Los Angeles Kings, the same year he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He left the Los Angeles team at the end of the 1998–99 season and signed on as an assistant coach with the New Jersey Devils once again. Named interim head coach of the New Jersey Devils on March 23, 2000, Robinson guided his team to win the 2000 Stanley Cup. With the victory, Robinson became the first interim head coach in NHL history to guide a team to the Stanley Cup. The feat would later be accomplished by Craig Berube in 2019. Robinson recounted to journalist Scott Morrison: Considering how long I played hockey and how many Cups I got to win as a defenseman with Montreal, it was my first Stanley Cup win as a head coach that is actually my greatest day in hockey. He stayed on as head coach for the next year and again guided the Devils to the Stanley Cup finals, where they lost against the Colorado Avalanche in seven games. Robinson was fired during the 2001–02 season, but returned as an assistant coach in February 2002 and just before the 2002–03 season to win his ninth Stanley Cup in 2003. When Pat Burns suffered a recurrence of cancer, Robinson again assumed the mantle of head coach on July 14, 2005. This stint came to an end on December 19, 2005, when Robinson resigned, citing stress and other health problems. Robinson returned to the Devils prior to the 2007–08 season as an assistant coach under Brent Sutter. Prior to the 2008–09 season, Robinson left from behind the Devils' bench to become a special assignment coach between the organization's prospects in Lowell, Mass., and the Devils. Robinson's contract ended with the New Jersey Devils in the summer of 2012. He indicated he was interested in becoming an assistant coach with the Montreal Canadiens, however that post was filled with former Hab J.J. Daigneault soon after. Robinson then was appointed an associate coach with the San Jose Sharks on July 10, 2012. On May 23, 2014, the Sharks added director of player development to Robinson's role. In 2017, at the end of his five-year contract with the Sharks, Robinson left the organization.
