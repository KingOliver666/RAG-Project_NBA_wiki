    "question": "In what year did AJ Green record his fourth consecutive 1,000 yard season despite missing three games and nearly all of two more due to a concussion?",
    "answer": "2015",
    "context": "In Week 5, against the New England Patriots, he re-aggravated his lingering toe injury and missed the following three games. In Week 14, he recorded 224 yards on 11 receptions (a 20.4 average) and one touchdown in a 42–21 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Green's 224 receiving yards marked the third most the Steelers had ever given up in a game to one player. Despite missing three games and nearly all of two more, Green still recorded his fourth consecutive 1,000 yard season, finishing the year with 69 receptions for 1,041 yards and six touchdowns. However, a concussion ultimately forced him to miss the postseason for the first time in his career. He was ranked 37th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015. 2015 season Green was an instrumental part of the Bengals recording a franchise-record tying 12 victories in 2015. In Week 3 of the 2015 season, Green caught 10 passes for a career-high 227 yards and two fourth quarter touchdowns in a 28–24 win over the Ravens. His 227 yards were the second highest single game total in franchise history, trailing only Chad Johnson's 260 receiving yards in a 2006 game against the Chargers.

He joined Randy Moss as the only players in NFL history to accomplish the feat at the time. During the Wild Card Round against the Steelers, he caught five passes for 71 yards and his first postseason touchdown, which put the Bengals up 16–15 with less than two minutes remaining. However, a late turnover and penalty by the Bengals loomed large as the Bengals lost 16–18. He earned his fifth straight Pro Bowl and was ranked 16th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016. 2016 season In the Bengals' season opener against the New York Jets, Green had 12 receptions for 180 receiving yards, including a 54-yard touchdown as the Bengals won by a score of 23–22.

In Week 7, the Bengals defeated the Browns while Green finished the win with eight receptions for 169 receiving yards and a 48-yard touchdown. The following game, Green recorded nine catches for 121 receiving yards in a 27–27 tie with the Redskins. Green returned in Week 10 and caught seven passes for 68 yards and a touchdown during the Bengals' 21–20 loss at the Giants. On November 20, Green sustained a tear to his hamstring in the first quarter of a 16–12 loss to the Buffalo Bills. He was inactive for the next five games before being placed on injured reserve prior to the regular-season finale. Green finished the 2016 season with 66 receptions, 964 receiving yards, and four touchdown receptions in 10 games. This marked the first time in Green's career that he failed to reach 1,000 receiving yards. Despite the injury, Green was named to his sixth straight Pro Bowl on December 20. He was ranked 17th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017. 2017 season In Week 3, against the Green Bay Packers, Green recorded ten receptions for 111 yards and one touchdown in the 27–24 overtime loss. In Week 5 against the Bills, Green had two passes deflected off his hands that were intercepted and he lost a fumble, but still had an impressive outing with seven receptions for 189 receiving yards as the Bengals won 20–16. In Week 9 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Green got into a fight with Jalen Ramsey, resulting in both players being ejected and his first ever foul. He was later fined $42,541."
