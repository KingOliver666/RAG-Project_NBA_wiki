      "Alaa Abdelnaby (Arabic: علاء عبد النبي; born June 24, 1968) is an Egyptian-American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils followed by a five-year National Basketball Association (NBA) career, and then stints in various other leagues. Abdelnaby is one of two Egyptian-born players in the history of the NBA, along with Abdel Nader. Abdelnaby works as a basketball broadcaster and analyst for NBCS Philadelphia, CBS Sports Network, and Westwood One Radio. Abdelnaby was born in Alexandria, Egypt, and moved to the United States with his family in 1971 at the age of two. His father was an engineer and his mother was a computer analyst who had moved to find better jobs. His family became American citizens. Abelnaby was raised in Nutley and Bloomfield, New Jersey, and played on the Bloomfield High School basketball team. Abdelnaby was selected as a standout American high school athlete as both a McDonald's All-American and a Parade All-American. Abdelnaby played at Duke University from 1986 to 1990. He had a breakout year as a senior when he averaged 14.9 points and 6.7 rebounds during the regular season. Abdelnaby was a third-team all-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) selection as a senior. He had a series of widely publicized off-court problems during his early seasons, including an accident where he drove his car into a tree on campus. Abdelnaby commented on Duke University's academic requirements: \"The only way I can make five A's is when I sign my name.\" Abdelnaby was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association with the 25th pick of the 1990 NBA draft, and he spent five years in the league, playing for Portland as well as the Milwaukee Bucks, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia 76ers, and Sacramento Kings. He was signed by the Golden State Warriors but he never played for that franchise. After leaving the NBA, Abdelnaby played for the Papagou BC (Greece) (1995–1996), the Omaha Racers (CBA)\n",
