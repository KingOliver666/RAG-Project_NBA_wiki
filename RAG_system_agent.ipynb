Nicknamed \"King James\", he is the NBA\\'s all-time leading scorer and has won four NBA championships from 10 NBA Finals appearances, having made eight consecutive appearances between 2011 and 2018. He also won the inaugural NBA Cup in 2023 with the Lakers and has won three Olympic gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team. In addition to ranking fourth in NBA career assists and sixth in NBA career steals, James holds several individual honors, including four NBA MVP awards, four Finals MVP awards, the Rookie of the Year award, three All-Star Game MVP awards, the inaugural NBA Cup MVP, and the Olympics MVP in the 2024 Summer Olympics. A record 21-time All-Star and 21-time All-NBA selection (including a record 13 First Team selections), he has also made six All-Defensive Teams. The oldest active player in the NBA, he is tied with Vince Carter for the most seasons played and holds the record for the most minutes played in league history. Born and raised in Akron, Ohio, James gained national attention at St. Vincent–St. Mary High School and was heavily touted as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities. A prep-to-pro, James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. He won Rookie of the Year and quickly established himself as one of the league\\'s premier players, leading Cleveland to its first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the scoring title in 2008. After winning back-to-back MVPs in 2009 and 2010, he left the Cavaliers and joined the Miami Heat as a free agent in 2010, a controversial move announced in the nationally televised special titled The Decision. With the Heat, James won his first two NBA championships in 2012 and 2013, earning MVP and Finals MVP honors both years. After four seasons in Miami, he returned to Cleveland in 2014, leading the Cavaliers to their first-ever championship in 2016 by overcoming a 3–1 deficit against the Golden State Warriors and ending the Cleveland sports curse. He signed with the Lakers in 2018, winning another title in 2020 and becoming the first player to win Finals MVP with three different teams. In 2023, he surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA\\'s all-time leading scorer, and in 2024, he and his son Bronny became the first father-son teammates in league history. In 2025, James was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a member of the 2008 U.S. Olympic team (also known as the \"Redeem Team\"). Off the court, James has earned further wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player. James has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He was among Time\\'s 100 most influential people in the world in 2005, 2013, 2017, and 2019 — the most selections for a professional athlete. James has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). He has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C.\\n\\nOn February 28, VanVleet was named one of the ten semi-finalists for the Naismith Award.\\n\\nDunstan\\'s Episcopal. In college, Duncan played for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons, and in his senior year, he received the John Wooden Award and was named the Naismith College Player of the Year and the USBWA College Player of the Year. After graduating from college, Duncan was the NBA Rookie of the Year after being selected by San Antonio with the first overall pick in the 1997 NBA draft. In his second season, he became the third player (alongside Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) to win NBA Finals MVP in his first two seasons after being drafted, guiding the Spurs to the 1999 NBA title. Known as a strong post defender, Duncan was selected to one of the two All-Defensive teams each of the first 13 seasons of his career, an NBA record. As part of the Spurs\\' Big Three with guards Tony Parker and Manu Ginóbili, Duncan won four additional NBA championships and collected three Finals MVP trophies. He primarily played the power forward position and also played center throughout his career. He is a five-time NBA champion, a two-time NBA MVP, a three-time NBA Finals MVP, a 15-time NBA All-Star, and the only player to be selected to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive Teams for 13 consecutive seasons. Duncan was born on April 25, 1976, and raised in Saint Croix, U.S.\\n\\nIt was his fourth career All-Star selection and first since 2018. Green missed 31 consecutive games from January to March with a back injury. Up to that point, he was mentioned as one of the favorites to win the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. Despite playing in just 46 games, Green was selected to his seventh NBA All-Defensive Team, earning second-team honors. The Warriors advanced to the 2022 NBA Finals, and he won his fourth NBA championship after they defeated the Celtics in six games. In Game 6 of the Finals, Green posted a near triple-double with 12 points, 12 rebounds, 8 assists, 2 steals and 2 blocks in a 103–90 closeout win. During a team practice with the Warriors on October 5, 2022, Green and teammate Jordan Poole got into an altercation, resulting in Green striking Poole in the face. TMZ published a leaked video on October 7, showing the punch but not what led to the incident. On October 9, Green publicly apologized for the incident and announced that he would spend a few days away from the team.\\n\\nLeonard played two seasons of college basketball for the San Diego State Aztecs and was named a consensus second-team All-American as a sophomore. He opted to forgo his final two seasons of college eligibility to enter the 2011 NBA draft. He was selected by the Indiana Pacers with the 15th overall pick before being traded to the San Antonio Spurs on draft night. With the Spurs, Leonard won an NBA championship in 2014, when he was named the Finals Most Valuable Player. After seven seasons with the Spurs, Leonard was traded to the Toronto Raptors in 2018. In 2019, he led the Raptors to their first NBA championship and won his second Finals MVP award (one of only three players to win Finals MVP with multiple teams, along with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and LeBron James). He subsequently moved to his hometown of Los Angeles and signed with the Clippers as a free agent in July 2019. Leonard attended Canyon Springs High School in Moreno Valley, California, before transferring to Martin Luther King High School for his junior year. In his senior year there, he and Tony Snell led the King High Wolves to a 30–3 record. Leonard averaged 22.6 points, 13.1 rebounds, 3.9 assists, and 3 blocks per game that year and was named California Mr. Basketball.\\n\\nIn 2021, he was selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.\\n\\nHe has been named to 11 All-NBA teams (including six First Teams) and selected 15 times as an NBA All-Star.

Durant was heavily recruited in high school, widely regarded as the second-best player his senior year. He played one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns, during which he won numerous year-end awards and became the first freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year. Durant was selected as the second overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft. He played nine seasons with the franchise (which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008), leading them to a Finals appearance in 2012 and winning the MVP award for the 2013–2014 season. He later signed with the Golden State Warriors in 2016, who won a record 73 regular season games the previous year. Durant won consecutive NBA championships and Finals MVPs in 2017 and 2018. After sustaining an Achilles injury in the 2019 NBA Finals, he joined the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent that summer. Following disagreements with the Nets\\' front office, he requested a trade during the 2022 offseason and was traded to the Suns the following year. As a member of the US national team, Durant has won four gold medals in the Olympics (2012, 2016, 2020 and 2024), and is the leading scorer in Team USA\\'s Olympic basketball history. Durant is the only player in basketball history with MVPs in the NBA, Olympics and World Cup. Off the court, Durant is one of the highest-earning basketball players in the world, due in part to endorsement deals with companies such as Foot Locker and Nike. He has developed a reputation for philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In 2018, Durant was among Time\\'s 100 most influential people in the world.\\n\\nBasketball recognition and was runner-up for Mr.\\n\\nDeclaring for the 2016 NBA draft after his freshman season, Brown was selected by the Celtics with the third overall pick.

      "Final Answer: Michael Jordan has won more NBA championships than LeBron James. Michael Jordan secured a total of six NBA championships during his career, all with the Chicago Bulls, winning titles in the years 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, and 1998. In contrast, LeBron James has won four NBA championships. He won his titles with three different teams: two with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013, one with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016, and one with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "While both players are often compared in discussions about the greatest basketball players of all time, Jordan's six championships give him an edge in that specific category. LeBron has made ten NBA Finals appearances, which is notable, but his championship count currently stands at four.\n"
